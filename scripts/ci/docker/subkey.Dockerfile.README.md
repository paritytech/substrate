# The `subkey` program is a key management utility for Substrate-based blockchains. You can use the `subkey` program to perform the following tasks:

* Generate and inspect cryptographically-secure public and private key pairs.
* Restore keys from secret phrases and raw seeds.
* Sign and verify signatures on messages.
* Sign and verify signatures for encoded transactions.
* Derive hierarchical deterministic child key pairs.
