<p><strong>Important</strong>: This crate is unstable and the API and usage may change.</p>
<h2 id="node-identities-and-addresses"><a href="#node-identities-and-addresses">Node identities and addresses</a></h2>
<p>In a decentralized network, each node possesses a network private key and a network public key.
In Substrate, the keys are based on the ed25519 curve.</p>
<p>From a node’s public key, we can derive its <em>identity</em>. In Substrate and libp2p, a node’s
identity is represented with the <a href="struct.PeerId.html" title="struct sc_network::PeerId"><code>PeerId</code></a> struct. All network communications between nodes on
the network use encryption derived from both sides’s keys, which means that <strong>identities cannot
be faked</strong>.</p>
<p>A node’s identity uniquely identifies a machine on the network. If you start two or more
clients using the same network key, large interferences will happen.</p>
<h2 id="substrates-network-protocol"><a href="#substrates-network-protocol">Substrate’s network protocol</a></h2>
<p>Substrate’s networking protocol is based upon libp2p. It is at the moment not possible and not
planned to permit using something else than the libp2p network stack and the rust-libp2p
library. However the libp2p framework is very flexible and the rust-libp2p library could be
extended to support a wider range of protocols than what is offered by libp2p.</p>
<h3 id="discovery-mechanisms"><a href="#discovery-mechanisms">Discovery mechanisms</a></h3>
<p>In order for our node to join a peer-to-peer network, it has to know a list of nodes that are
part of said network. This includes nodes identities and their address (how to reach them).
Building such a list is called the <strong>discovery</strong> mechanism. There are three mechanisms that
Substrate uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap nodes. These are hard-coded node identities and addresses passed alongside with
the network configuration.</li>
<li>mDNS. We perform a UDP broadcast on the local network. Nodes that listen may respond with
their identity. More info <a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/discovery/mdns.md">here</a>.
mDNS can be disabled in the network configuration.</li>
<li>Kademlia random walk. Once connected, we perform random Kademlia <code>FIND_NODE</code> requests on the
configured Kademlia DHTs (one per configured chain protocol) in order for nodes to propagate to
us their view of the network. More information about Kademlia can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia">on
Wikipedia</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connection-establishment"><a href="#connection-establishment">Connection establishment</a></h3>
<p>When node Alice knows node Bob’s identity and address, it can establish a connection with Bob.
All connections must always use encryption and multiplexing. While some node addresses (eg.
addresses using <code>/quic</code>) already imply which encryption and/or multiplexing to use, for others
the <strong>multistream-select</strong> protocol is used in order to negotiate an encryption layer and/or a
multiplexing layer.</p>
<p>The connection establishment mechanism is called the <strong>transport</strong>.</p>
<p>As of the writing of this documentation, the following base-layer protocols are supported by
Substrate:</p>
<ul>
<li>TCP/IP for addresses of the form <code>/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/5</code>. Once the TCP connection is open, an
encryption and a multiplexing layer are negotiated on top.</li>
<li>WebSockets for addresses of the form <code>/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/5/ws</code>. A TCP/IP connection is open and
the WebSockets protocol is negotiated on top. Communications then happen inside WebSockets data
frames. Encryption and multiplexing are additionally negotiated again inside this channel.</li>
<li>DNS for addresses of the form <code>/dns/example.com/tcp/5</code> or <code>/dns/example.com/tcp/5/ws</code>. A
node’s address can contain a domain name.</li>
<li>(All of the above using IPv6 instead of IPv4.)</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of the base-layer protocol, the <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/">Noise</a> protocol is
negotiated and applied. The exact handshake protocol is experimental and is subject to change.</p>
<p>The following multiplexing protocols are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/blob/master/spec.md">Yamux</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="substreams"><a href="#substreams">Substreams</a></h3>
<p>Once a connection has been established and uses multiplexing, substreams can be opened. When
a substream is open, the <strong>multistream-select</strong> protocol is used to negotiate which protocol
to use on that given substream.</p>
<p>Protocols that are specific to a certain chain have a <code>&lt;protocol-id&gt;</code> in their name. This
“protocol ID” is defined in the chain specifications. For example, the protocol ID of Polkadot
is “dot”. In the protocol names below, <code>&lt;protocol-id&gt;</code> must be replaced with the corresponding
protocol ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It is possible for the same connection to be used for multiple chains. For example,
one can use both the <code>/dot/sync/2</code> and <code>/sub/sync/2</code> protocols on the same
connection, provided that the remote supports them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Substrate uses the following standard libp2p protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>/ipfs/ping/1.0.0</code></strong>. We periodically open an ephemeral substream in order to ping the
remote and check whether the connection is still alive. Failure for the remote to reply leads
to a disconnection.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/identify"><code>/ipfs/id/1.0.0</code></a></strong>. We
periodically open an ephemeral substream in order to ask information from the remote.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libp2p/specs/pull/108"><code>/&lt;protocol_id&gt;/kad</code></a></strong>. We periodically open
ephemeral substreams for Kademlia random walk queries. Each Kademlia query is done in a
separate substream.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Substrate uses the following non-libp2p-standard protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>/substrate/&lt;protocol-id&gt;/&lt;version&gt;</code></strong> (where <code>&lt;protocol-id&gt;</code> must be replaced with the
protocol ID of the targeted chain, and <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> is a number between 2 and 6). For each
connection we optionally keep an additional substream for all Substrate-based communications
alive. This protocol is considered legacy, and is progressively being replaced with
alternatives. This is designated as “The legacy Substrate substream” in this documentation. See
below for more details.</li>
<li><strong><code>/&lt;protocol-id&gt;/sync/2</code></strong> is a request-response protocol (see below) that lets one perform
requests for information about blocks. Each request is the encoding of a <code>BlockRequest</code> and
each response is the encoding of a <code>BlockResponse</code>, as defined in the <code>api.v1.proto</code> file in
this source tree.</li>
<li><strong><code>/&lt;protocol-id&gt;/light/2</code></strong> is a request-response protocol (see below) that lets one perform
light-client-related requests for information about the state. Each request is the encoding of
a <code>light::Request</code> and each response is the encoding of a <code>light::Response</code>, as defined in the
<code>light.v1.proto</code> file in this source tree.</li>
<li><strong><code>/&lt;protocol-id&gt;/transactions/1</code></strong> is a notifications protocol (see below) where
transactions are pushed to other nodes. The handshake is empty on both sides. The message
format is a SCALE-encoded list of transactions, where each transaction is an opaque list of
bytes.</li>
<li><strong><code>/&lt;protocol-id&gt;/block-announces/1</code></strong> is a notifications protocol (see below) where
block announces are pushed to other nodes. The handshake is empty on both sides. The message
format is a SCALE-encoded tuple containing a block header followed with an opaque list of
bytes containing some data associated with this block announcement, e.g. a candidate message.</li>
<li>Notifications protocols that are registered using
<code>NetworkConfiguration::notifications_protocols</code>. For example: <code>/paritytech/grandpa/1</code>. See
below for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-legacy-substrate-substream"><a href="#the-legacy-substrate-substream">The legacy Substrate substream</a></h3>
<p>Substrate uses a component named the <strong>peerset manager (PSM)</strong>. Through the discovery
mechanism, the PSM is aware of the nodes that are part of the network and decides which nodes
we should perform Substrate-based communications with. For these nodes, we open a connection
if necessary and open a unique substream for Substrate-based communications. If the PSM decides
that we should disconnect a node, then that substream is closed.</p>
<p>For more information about the PSM, see the <em>sc-peerset</em> crate.</p>
<p>Note that at the moment there is no mechanism in place to solve the issues that arise where the
two sides of a connection open the unique substream simultaneously. In order to not run into
issues, only the dialer of a connection is allowed to open the unique substream. When the
substream is closed, the entire connection is closed as well. This is a bug that will be
resolved by deprecating the protocol entirely.</p>
<p>Within the unique Substrate substream, messages encoded using
<a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec"><em>parity-scale-codec</em></a> are exchanged.
The detail of theses messages is not totally in place, but they can be found in the
<code>message.rs</code> file.</p>
<p>Once the substream is open, the first step is an exchange of a <em>status</em> message from both
sides, containing information such as the chain root hash, head of chain, and so on.</p>
<p>Communications within this substream include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syncing. Blocks are announced and requested from other nodes.</li>
<li>Light-client requests. When a light client requires information, a random node we have a
substream open with is chosen, and the information is requested from it.</li>
<li>Gossiping. Used for example by grandpa.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="request-response-protocols"><a href="#request-response-protocols">Request-response protocols</a></h3>
<p>A so-called request-response protocol is defined as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a substream is opened, the opening side sends a message whose content is
protocol-specific. The message must be prefixed with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128">LEB128-encoded number</a> indicating its length. After the
message has been sent, the writing side is closed.</li>
<li>The remote sends back the response prefixed with a LEB128-encoded length, and closes its
side as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each request is performed in a new separate substream.</p>
<h3 id="notifications-protocols"><a href="#notifications-protocols">Notifications protocols</a></h3>
<p>A so-called notifications protocol is defined as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a substream is opened, the opening side sends a handshake message whose content is
protocol-specific. The handshake message must be prefixed with an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128">LEB128-encoded number</a> indicating its length. The
handshake message can be of length 0, in which case the sender has to send a single <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>The receiver then either immediately closes the substream, or answers with its own
LEB128-prefixed protocol-specific handshake response. The message can be of length 0, in which
case a single <code>0</code> has to be sent back.</li>
<li>Once the handshake has completed, the notifications protocol is unidirectional. Only the
node which initiated the substream can push notifications. If the remote wants to send
notifications as well, it has to open its own undirectional substream.</li>
<li>Each notification must be prefixed with an LEB128-encoded length. The encoding of the
messages is specific to each protocol.</li>
<li>Either party can signal that it doesn’t want a notifications substream anymore by closing
its writing side. The other party should respond by closing its own writing side soon after.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API of <code>sc-network</code> allows one to register user-defined notification protocols.
<code>sc-network</code> automatically tries to open a substream towards each node for which the legacy
Substream substream is open. The handshake is then performed automatically.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>sc-consensus-grandpa</code> crate registers the <code>/paritytech/grandpa/1</code>
notifications protocol.</p>
<p>At the moment, for backwards-compatibility, notification protocols are tied to the legacy
Substrate substream. Additionally, the handshake message is hardcoded to be a single 8-bits
integer representing the role of the node:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 for a full node.</li>
<li>2 for a light node.</li>
<li>4 for an authority.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the future, though, these restrictions will be removed.</p>
<h2 id="usage"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Using the <code>sc-network</code> crate is done through the <a href="struct.NetworkWorker.html" title="struct sc_network::NetworkWorker"><code>NetworkWorker</code></a> struct. Create this
struct by passing a <a href="config/struct.Params.html" title="struct sc_network::config::Params"><code>config::Params</code></a>, then poll it as if it was a <code>Future</code>. You can extract an
<code>Arc&lt;NetworkService&gt;</code> from the <code>NetworkWorker</code>, which can be shared amongst multiple places
in order to give orders to the networking.</p>
<p>See the <a href="config/index.html" title="mod sc_network::config"><code>config</code></a> module for more information about how to configure the networking.</p>
<p>After the <code>NetworkWorker</code> has been created, the important things to do are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calling <code>NetworkWorker::poll</code> in order to advance the network. This can be done by
dispatching a background task with the <a href="struct.NetworkWorker.html" title="struct sc_network::NetworkWorker"><code>NetworkWorker</code></a>.</li>
<li>Calling <code>on_block_import</code> whenever a block is added to the client.</li>
<li>Calling <code>on_block_finalized</code> whenever a block is finalized.</li>
<li>Calling <code>trigger_repropagate</code> when a transaction is added to the pool.</li>
</ul>
<p>More precise usage details are still being worked on and will likely change in the future.</p>

if the signature was made by the entity that controls a given <code>PeerId</code>.</div></li><li><div class="item-name"><a class="struct" href="struct.StateDownloadProgress.html" title="struct sc_network::StateDownloadProgress">StateDownloadProgress</a></div><div class="desc docblock-short">Reported state download progress.</div></li><li><div class="item-name"><a class="struct" href="struct.WarpSyncProgress.html" title="struct sc_network::WarpSyncProgress">WarpSyncProgress</a></div><div class="desc docblock-short">Reported warp sync progress.</div></li></ul><h2 id="enums" class="small-section-header"><a href="#enums">Enums</a></h2><ul class="item-table"><li><div class="item-name"><a class="enum" href="enum.Keypair.html" title="enum sc_network::Keypair">Keypair</a></div><div class="desc docblock-short">Identity keypair of a node.</div></li><li><div class="item-name"><a class="enum" href="enum.NotificationSenderError.html" title="enum sc_network::NotificationSenderError">NotificationSenderError</a></div><div class="desc docblock-short">Error returned by <a href="trait.NetworkNotification.html#tymethod.notification_sender" title="method sc_network::NetworkNotification::notification_sender"><code>NetworkNotification::notification_sender</code></a>.</div></li><li><div class="item-name"><a class="enum" href="enum.ObservedRole.html" title="enum sc_network::ObservedRole">ObservedRole</a></div><div class="desc docblock-short">Role that the peer sent to us during the handshake, with the addition of what our local node
