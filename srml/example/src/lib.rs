//! # Example Module
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//! The Example: A simple example of a runtime module demonstrating
//! concepts, APIs and structures common to most runtime modules.
//!
//! Run `cargo doc --package srml-example --open` to view this module's documentation.
//!
//! ### Documentation Guidelines:
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: Various. Based on collation of review comments to PRs addressing issues with -->
//! <!-- label 'S3-SRML' in https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-developer-hub/issues -->
//! <ul>
//!     <li>Documentation comments (i.e. <code>/// comment</code>) - should
//!         accompany module functions and be restricted to the module interface,
//!         not the internals of the module implementation. Only state inputs,
//!         outputs, and a brief description that mentions whether calling it
//!         requires root, but without repeating the source code details.
//!         Capitalise the first word of each documentation comment and end it with
//!         a full stop. See
//!         <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate#72-contributing-to-documentation-for-substrate-packages"
//!         target="_blank"> Generic example of annotating source code with documentation comments</a></li>
//!     <li>Self-documenting code - Try to refactor code to be self-documenting.</li>
//!     <li>Code comments - Supplement complex code with a brief explanation, not every line of code.</li>
//!     <li>Identifiers - surround by backticks (i.e. <code>INHERENT_IDENTIFIER</code>, <code>InherentType</code>,
//!         <code>u64</code>)</li>
//!     <li>Usage scenarios - should be simple doctests. The compiler should ensure they stay valid.</li>
//!     <li>Extended tutorials - should be moved to external files and refer to.</li>
//!     <!-- Original author of paragraph: @AmarRSingh -->
//!     <li>Mandatory - include all of the sections/subsections where <b>MUST</b> is specified.</li>
//!     <li>Optional - optionally include sections/subsections where <b>CAN</b> is specified.</li>
//! </ul>
//!
//! ### Documentation Template:<br>
//!
//! Copy and paste this template from srml/example/src/lib.rs into file
//! `srml/<INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME>/src/lib.rs` of your own custom module and complete it.
//! <details><p><pre>
//! // Add heading with custom module name
//!
//! \# <INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME> Module
//!
//! // Add simple description
//!
//! // Include the following links that shows what trait needs to be implemented to use the module
//! // and the supported dispatchables that are documented in the Call enum.
//!
//! - \[`<INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME>::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)

//! \## Overview
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: Various. See https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-developer-hub/issues/44 -->
//! // Short description of module purpose.
//! // Links to Traits that should be implemented.
//! // What this module is for.
//! // What functionality the module provides.
//! // When to use the module (use case examples).
//! // How it is used.
//! // Inputs it uses and the source of each input.
//! // Outputs it produces.
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @Kianenigma in PR https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/1951 -->
//! <!-- and comment https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-developer-hub/issues/44#issuecomment-471982710 -->
//!
//! \## Terminology
//!
//! // Add terminology used in the custom module. Include concepts, storage items, or actions that you think
//! // deserve to be noted to give context to the rest of the documentation or module usage. The author needs to
//! // use some judgment about what is included. We don't want a list of every storage item nor types - the user
//! // can go to the code for that. For example, "transfer fee" is obvious and should not be included, but
//! // "free balance" and "reserved balance" should be noted to give context to the module.
//! // Please do not link to outside resources. The reference docs should be the ultimate source of truth.
//!
//! <!-- Original author of heading: @Kianenigma in PR https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/1951 -->
//!
//! \## Goals
//!
//! // Add goals that the custom module is designed to achieve.
//!
//! <!-- Original author of heading: @Kianenigma in PR https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/1951 -->
//!
//! \### Scenarios
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @Kianenigma. Based on PR https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/1951 -->
//!
//! \#### <INSERT_SCENARIO_NAME>
//!
//! // Describe requirements prior to interacting with the custom module.
//! // Describe the process of interacting with the custom module for this scenario and public API functions used.
//!
//! \## Interface
//!
//! \### Supported Origins
//!
//! // What origins are used and supported in this module (root, signed, none)
//! // i.e. root when <code>\`ensure_root\`</code> used
//! // i.e. none when <code>\`ensure_none\`</code> used
//! // i.e. signed when <code>\`ensure_signed\`</code> used
//!
//! <code>\`inherent\`</code> <INSERT_DESCRIPTION>

//! \### Types
//!
//! // Type aliases. Include any associated types and where the user would typically define them.
//!
//! <code>\`ExampleType\`</code> <INSERT_DESCRIPTION>
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: ??? -->
//!
//! // Reference documentation of aspects such as `storageItems` and `dispatchable` functions should only be

//! \### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @AmarRSingh & @joepetrowski -->
//!
//! // A brief description of dispatchable functions and a link to the rustdoc with their actual documentation.
//!
//! // <b>MUST</b> have link to Call enum
//! // <b>MUST</b> have origin information included in function doc

//!
//! \### Public Functions
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @joepetrowski -->
//!
//! // A link to the rustdoc and any notes about usage in the module, not for specific functions.
//! // For example, in the balances module: "Note that when using the publicly exposed functions,
//! // you (the runtime developer) are responsible for implementing any necessary checks
//! // (e.g. that the sender is the signer) before calling a function that will affect storage."
//!
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @AmarRSingh -->
//!
//! // It is up to the writer of the respective module (with respect to how much information to provide).
//!
//! \#### Public Inspection functions - Immutable (getters)
//!
//! // Insert a subheading for each getter function signature
//!
//! \##### <code>\`example_getter_name()\`</code>
//!
//! // What it returns

//!
//! // Insert a subheading for each setter function signature
//!
//! \##### <code>\`example_setter_name(origin, parameter_name: T::ExampleType)\`</code>
//!
//! // What state it changes

//! // use <INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME> module in a custom module.
//!
//! \### Prerequisites
//!
//! // Show how to include necessary imports for <INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME> and derive
//! // your module configuration trait with the `INSERT_CUSTOM_MODULE_NAME` trait.

// Anyone can have these functions execute by signing and submitting

// using storage space proportional to any costs paid for by the caller or otherwise the
// difficulty of forcing the call to happen.
//
// Generally you'll want to split these into three groups:
// - Public calls that are signed by an external account.
// - Root calls that are allowed to be made only by the governance system.
// - Unsigned calls that can be of two kinds:
//   * "Inherent extrinsics" that are opinions generally held by the block
//     authors that build child blocks.
//   * Unsigned Transactions that are of intrinsic recognisable utility to the
//     network, and are validated by the runtime.
//
// Information about where this dispatch initiated from is provided as the first argument
// "origin". As such functions must always look like:
//
// `fn foo(origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) -> Result;`
//
// The `Result` is required as part of the syntax (and expands to the conventional dispatch
// result of `Result<(), &'static str>`).
//
// When you come to `impl` them later in the module, you must specify the full type for `origin`:
//
// `fn foo(origin: T::Origin, bar: Bar, baz: Baz) { ... }`
//
// There are three entries in the `system::Origin` enum that correspond
// to the above bullets: `::Signed(AccountId)`, `::Root` and `::None`. You should always match
// against them as the first thing you do in your function. There are three convenience calls
// in system that do the matching for you and return a convenient result: `ensure_signed`,
// `ensure_root` and `ensure_none`.

		/// This is your public interface. Be extremely careful.
		/// This is just a simple example of how to interact with the module from the external
		/// world.
		// This just increases the value of `Dummy` by `increase_by`.
		//
		// Since this is a dispatched function there are two extremely important things to
		// remember:
		//
		// - MUST NOT PANIC: Under no circumstances (save, perhaps, storage getting into an
		// irreparably damaged state) must this function panic.
		// - NO SIDE-EFFECTS ON ERROR: This function must either complete totally (and return
		// `Ok(())` or it must have no side-effects on storage and return `Err('Some reason')`.
		//
		// The first is relatively easy to audit for - just ensure all panickers are removed from
		// logic that executes in production (which you do anyway, right?!). To ensure the second
		// is followed, you should do all tests for validity at the top of your function. This
		// is stuff like checking the sender (`origin`) or that state is such that the operation
		// makes sense.
		//
		// Once you've determined that it's all good, then enact the operation and change storage.
		// If you can't be certain that the operation will succeed without substantial computation
		// then you have a classic blockchain attack scenario. The normal way of managing this is
		// to attach a bond to the operation. As the first major alteration of storage, reserve
		// some value from the sender's account (`Balances` module has a `reserve` function for
		// exactly this scenario). This amount should be enough to cover any costs of the
		// substantial execution in case it turns out that you can't proceed with the operation.
		//
		// If it eventually transpires that the operation is fine and, therefore, that the
		// expense of the checks should be borne by the network, then you can refund the reserved
		// deposit. If, however, the operation turns out to be invalid and the computation is
		// wasted, then you can burn it or repatriate elsewhere.
		//
		// Security bonds ensure that attackers can't game it by ensuring that anyone interacting
		// with the system either progresses it or pays for the trouble of faffing around with
		// no progress.
		//
		// If you don't respect these rules, it is likely that your chain will be attackable.
		//
		// Each transaction can optionally indicate a weight. The weight is passed in as a
		// custom attribute and the value can be anything that implements the `Weighable`
		// trait. Most often using substrate's default `TransactionWeight` is enough for you.
		//
		// A basic weight is a tuple of `(base_weight, byte_weight)`. Upon including each transaction
		// in a block, the final weight is calculated as `base_weight + byte_weight * tx_size`.
		// If this value, added to the weight of all included transactions, exceeds `MAX_TRANSACTION_WEIGHT`,
		// the transaction is not included. If no weight attribute is provided, the `::default()`
		// implementation of `TransactionWeight` is used.
		//
		// The example below showcases a transaction which is relatively costly, but less dependent on
		// the input, hence `byte_weight` is configured smaller.
