## Unreleased

## 2.0.1-> 3.0.0 - Apollo 14

Most notably, this is the first release of the new FRAME (2.0) with its new macro-syntax and some changes in types, and pallet versioning. This release also incorporates the faster and improve version 2.0 of the parity-scale-codec and upgraded dependencies all-around. While the `FinalityTracker` pallet has been dropped, this release marks the first public appearance of a few new pallets, too;Bounties, Lottery, Tips (extracted from the `Treasury`-pallet, see #7536) and Merkle-Mountain-Ranges (MMR).

On the client side, the most notable changes are around the keystore, making it async and switching to a different signing model allowing for remote-signing to be implemented; and various changes to improve networking and light-client support, like adding the Grandpa warp sync request-response protocol (#7711).

_Contracts_: Please note that the contracts pallet _is not part_ of this release. The pallet is not yet ready and will be released separately in the coming weeks. The currently released contracts pallet _is not compatible_ with the new FRAME, thus if you need the contracts pallet, we recommend you wait with the upgrade until it has been released, too.
### Upgrade instructions

Not too much has changed on the top and API level for developing Substrate between 2.0 and 3.0. The easiest and quickest path for upgrading is just to take the latest node-template and try applying your changes to it:
1. take a diff between 2.0 and your changes
2. store that diff
3. remove everything, copy over the 3.0 node-template
4. try re-applying your diff, manually, a hunk at a time.

If that doesn't work for you, we are working on an in-depth-guide for all major changes that took place and how you need to adapt your code for it. [You can find the upgrade guide under `docs/` in the repo](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/docs/Upgrading-2.0-to-3.0.md), if you have further questions or problem, please [feel free to ask in the github discussion board](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/discussions).
