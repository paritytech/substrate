# Lists some code owners.
#
# A codeowner just oversees some part of the codebase. If an owned file is changed then the
# corresponding codeowner receives a review request. An approval of the codeowner is
# not required for merging a PR though.
#
# **This is pretty much an experiment at the moment**. Feel free to remove yourself at any time if
# you do not want to receive review requests any longer.
#
# For details about syntax, see:
# https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners
# But here are some important notes:
#
# - Glob syntax is git-like, e.g. `/core` means the core directory in the root, unlike `core` which
#   can be everywhere.
# - Multiple owners are supported.
# - Either handle (e.g, @pepyakin) or email can be used. Keep in mind, that handles might work better because they
#   are more recognizable on GitHub, you can use them for mentioning unlike an email.
# - The latest matching rule, if multiple, takes precedence.
