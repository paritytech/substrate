= Subkey

Subkey is a commandline utility included with Substrate that generates or restores Substrate keys. 

`subkey` will use the http://wiki.polkadot.network/en/latest/polkadot/learn/cryptography/#keypairs-and-signing[sr25519] cryptography by default. If you need to use the older ed25519 cryptography to generate or restore your key pass the `--ed25519` flag to any of the commands.

== Usage

=== Generate a random account

```bash
subkey generate
```

Will output a secret phrase("mnemonic phrase") and give you the secret seed("Private Key"), public key("Account ID") and SS58 address("Public Address") of a new account. DO NOT SHARE your mnemonic phrase or secret seed with ANYONE it will give them access to your funds. If someone is making a transfer to you they will only need your **Public Address**.

=== Inspecting a key

You can inspect a given URI (mnemonic, seed, public key, or address) and recover the public key and the address.

```bash
subkey inspect <mnemonic,seed,pubkey,address>
```
_Example Output_:
```
Secret Key URI `` is account:
  Secret seed:       0xfac7959dbfe72f052e5a0c3c8d6530f202b02fd8f9f5ca3580ec8deb7797479e
  Public key (hex):  0x46ebddef8cd9bb167dc30878d7113b7e168e6f0646beffd77d69d39bad76b47a
  Public key (SS58): 5DfhGyQdFobKM8NsWvEeAKk5EQQgYe9AydgJ7rMB6E1EqRzV
  Account ID:        0x46ebddef8cd9bb167dc30878d7113b7e168e6f0646beffd77d69d39bad76b47a
  SS58 Address:      5DfhGyQdFobKM8NsWvEeAKk5EQQgYe9AydgJ7rMB6E1EqRzV
```

=== Signing

`subkey` expects a message to come in on STDIN, one way to sign a message would look like this:

```bash
echo -n <msg> | subkey sign --suri <seed,mnemonic>
```
_Example Output_:
```
a69da4a6ccbf81dbbbfad235fa12cf8528c18012b991ae89214de8d20d29c1280576ced6eb38b7406d1b7e03231df6dd4a5257546ddad13259356e1c3adfb509
```

=== Verifying a signature

```bash
echo -n <msg> | subkey verify <sig> <address>

OUTPUT:
Signature verifies correctly.
```

=== Using the vanity generator

You can use the included vanity generator to find a seed that provides an address which includes the desired pattern. Be warned, depending on your hardware this may take a while.

```bash
subkey vanity 1337
```

=== Signing a transaction

Sign a transaction from an encoded `Call`.

```bash
subkey sign-transaction \
	--call <call-as-hex> \
	--nonce 0 \
	--suri <secret-uri> \
	--password <password> \
	--prior-block-hash <prior-block-hash-as-hex>
```

Will output a signed and encoded `UncheckedMortalCompactExtrinsic` as hex.

=== Inspecting a module ID

```bash
subkey module-id "py/trsry" --network kusama
```
_Example Output_:
```
Public Key URI `F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29` is account:
  Network ID/version: kusama
  Public key (hex):   0x6d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  Public key (SS58):  F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29
  Account ID:         0x6d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  SS58 Address:       F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29
```
