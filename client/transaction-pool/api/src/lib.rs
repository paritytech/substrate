/// 2. Inside `Ready` queue:
/// 		- `Broadcast`
/// 3. Leaving the pool:

/// there might be cases where transactions alternate between `Future` and `Ready`
/// pool, and are `Broadcast` in the meantime.
///
/// There is also only single event causing the transaction to leave the pool.
/// I.e. only one of the listed ones should be triggered.
///
/// Note that there are conditions that may cause transactions to reappear in the pool.
/// 1. Due to possible forks, the transaction that ends up being in included
/// in one block, may later re-enter the pool or be marked as invalid.
/// 2. Transaction `Dropped` at one point, may later re-enter the pool if some other
/// transactions are removed.
/// 3. `Invalid` transaction may become valid at some point in the future.
/// (Note that runtimes are encouraged to use `UnknownValidity` to inform the pool about
/// such case).
/// 4. `Retracted` transactions might be included in some next block.
///
/// The stream is considered finished only when either `Finalized` or `FinalityTimeout`
/// event is triggered. You are however free to unsubscribe from notifications at any point.
/// The first one will be emitted when the block, in which transaction was included gets
/// finalized. The `FinalityTimeout` event will be emitted when the block did not reach finality
