//! Substrate Client and associated logic.
//!
//! The [`Client`] is one of the most important components of Substrate. It mainly comprises two
//! parts:
//!
//! - A database containing the blocks and chain state, generally referred to as
//! the [`Backend`](sc_client_api::backend::Backend).
//! - A runtime environment, generally referred to as the
//! [`Executor`](sc_client_api::call_executor::CallExecutor).
//!
//! # Initialization
//!
//! Creating a [`Client`] is done by calling the `new` method and passing to it a
//! [`Backend`](sc_client_api::backend::Backend) and an
//! [`Executor`](sc_client_api::call_executor::CallExecutor).
//!
//! The former is typically provided by the `sc-client-db` crate.
//!
//! The latter typically requires passing one of:
//!
//! - A [`LocalCallExecutor`] running the runtime locally.
//! - A [`RemoteCallExecutor`](sc_client_api::light::RemoteCallRequest) that will ask a
//! third-party to perform the executions.
//! - A [`RemoteOrLocalCallExecutor`](sc_client_api::light::LocalOrRemote), combination of the two.
//!
//! Additionally, the fourth generic parameter of the `Client` is a marker type representing
//! the ways in which the runtime can interface with the outside. Any code that builds a `Client`
//! is responsible for putting the right marker.
