/// provides a way to lock the shared data, while not having the mutex locked. So, the data stays
/// locked and we are still able to hold this lock over an `await` call.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
///# use sc_consensus::shared_data::SharedData;
///
/// let shared_data = SharedData::new(String::from("hello world"));
///
/// let lock = shared_data.shared_data_locked();
///
/// let shared_data2 = shared_data.clone();
/// let join_handle1 = std::thread::spawn(move || {
///     // This will need to wait for the outer lock to be released before it can access the data.
///     shared_data2.shared_data().push_str("1");
/// });
///
/// assert_eq!(*lock, "hello world");
///
/// // Let us release the mutex, but we still keep it locked.
/// // Now we could call `await` for example.
/// let mut lock = lock.release_mutex();
///
/// let shared_data2 = shared_data.clone();
/// let join_handle2 = std::thread::spawn(move || {
///     shared_data2.shared_data().push_str("2");

/// // We still have the lock and can upgrade it to access the data.
