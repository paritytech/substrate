//! # Features
//!
//! ## metered
//!
//! This feature changes the behaviour of the function `mpsc::tracing_unbounded`.
//! With the disabled feature this function is an alias to `futures::channel::mpsc::unbounded`.
//! However, when the feature is enabled it creates wrapper types to `UnboundedSender<T>`
//! and `UnboundedReceiver<T>` to register every `send`/`received`/`dropped` action happened on
//! the channel.
//!
//! Also this feature creates and registers a prometheus vector with name `unbounded_channel_len`
//! and labels:
//!
//! | Label        | Description                                   |
//! | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
//! | entity       | Name of channel passed to `tracing_unbounded` |
//! | action       | One of `send`/`received`/`dropped`            |
