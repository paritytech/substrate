	/// The `state_traceBlock` RPC provides a way to trace the re-execution of a single
	/// block, collecting Spans and Events from both the client and the relevant WASM runtime.
	/// The Spans and Events are conceptually equivalent to those from the [Tracing][1] crate.
	///
	/// The structure of the traces follows that of the block execution pipeline, so meaningful
	/// interpretation of the traces requires an understanding of the Substrate chain's block
	/// execution.
	///
	/// [Link to conceptual map of trace structure for Polkadot and Kusama block execution.][2]

	///
	/// ## Node requirements
	///
	/// - Fully synced archive node (i.e. a node that is not actively doing a "major" sync).
	/// - [Tracing enabled WASM runtimes](#creating-tracing-enabled-wasm-runtimes) for all runtime
	///   versions
	/// for which tracing is desired.
	///
	/// ## Node recommendations
	///
	/// - Use fast SSD disk storage.
	/// - Run node flags to increase DB read speed (i.e. `--state-cache-size`, `--db-cache`).
	///
	/// ## Creating tracing enabled WASM runtimes
	///
	/// - Checkout commit of chain version to compile with WASM traces
	/// - [diener][1] can help to peg commit of substrate to what the chain expects.
	/// - Navigate to the `runtime` folder/package of the chain
	/// - Add feature `with-tracing = ["frame-executive/with-tracing", "sp-io/with-tracing"]`
	/// under `[features]` to the `runtime` packages' `Cargo.toml`.
	/// - Compile the runtime with `cargo build --release --features with-tracing`
	/// - Tracing-enabled WASM runtime should be found in
	///   `./target/release/wbuild/{{chain}}-runtime`
	/// and be called something like `{{your_chain}}_runtime.compact.wasm`. This can be
	/// renamed/modified however you like, as long as it retains the `.wasm` extension.
	/// - Run the node with the wasm blob overrides by placing them in a folder with all your
	///   runtimes,
	/// and passing the path of this folder to your chain, e.g.:
	/// - `./target/release/polkadot --wasm-runtime-overrides /home/user/my-custom-wasm-runtimes`
	///
	/// You can also find some pre-built tracing enabled wasm runtimes in [substrate-archive][2]
	///

	///
	/// ## RPC Usage
	///
	/// The RPC allows for two filtering mechanisms: tracing targets and storage key prefixes.
	/// The filtering of spans and events takes place after they are all collected; so while filters
	/// do not reduce time for actual block re-execution, they reduce the response payload size.
	///
	/// Note: storage events primarily come from _primitives/state-machine/src/ext.rs_.
	/// The default filters can be overridden, see the [params section](#params) for details.
	///
	/// ### `curl` example
	///
	/// - Get tracing spans and events
	/// ```text

	/// 	http://localhost:9933/
	/// ```
	///
	/// - Get tracing events with all `storage_keys`
	/// ```text
	/// curl \
	/// 	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \

	/// 	http://localhost:9933/
	/// ```
	///
	/// - Get tracing events with `storage_keys` ('f0c365c3cf59d671eb72da0e7a4113c4')
	/// ```text
	/// curl \
	/// 	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	/// 	-d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_traceBlock", \
	/// 		"params": ["0xb246acf1adea1f801ce15c77a5fa7d8f2eb8fed466978bcee172cc02cf64e264", "state", "f0c365c3cf59d671eb72da0e7a4113c4", ""]}' \
	/// 	http://localhost:9933/
	/// ```
	///
	/// - Get tracing events with `storage_keys` ('f0c365c3cf59d671eb72da0e7a4113c4') and method
	///   ('Put')
	/// ```text
	/// curl \
	/// 	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	/// 	-d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_traceBlock", \
	/// 		"params": ["0xb246acf1adea1f801ce15c77a5fa7d8f2eb8fed466978bcee172cc02cf64e264", "state", "f0c365c3cf59d671eb72da0e7a4113c4", "Put"]}' \
	/// 	http://localhost:9933/
	/// ```
	///
	/// - Get tracing events with all `storage_keys` and method ('Put')
	/// ```text
	/// curl \
	/// 	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	/// 	-d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "state_traceBlock", \
	/// 		"params": ["0xb246acf1adea1f801ce15c77a5fa7d8f2eb8fed466978bcee172cc02cf64e264", "state", "", "Put"]}' \

	/// ```
	///
	/// ### Params
	///
	/// - `block` (param index 0): Hash of the block to trace.
	/// - `targets` (param index 1): String of comma separated (no spaces) targets. Specified
	/// targets match with trace targets by prefix (i.e if a target is in the beginning
	/// of a trace target it is considered a match). If an empty string is specified no
	/// targets will be filtered out. The majority of targets correspond to Rust module names,
	/// and the ones that do not are typically "hardcoded" into span or event location
	/// somewhere in the Substrate source code. ("Non-hardcoded" targets typically come from frame
	/// support macros.)
	/// - `storage_keys` (param index 2): String of comma separated (no spaces) hex encoded
	/// (no `0x` prefix) storage keys. If an empty string is specified no events will
	/// be filtered out. If anything other than an empty string is specified, events
	/// will be filtered by storage key (so non-storage events will **not** show up).
	/// You can specify any length of a storage key prefix (i.e. if a specified storage
	/// key is in the beginning of an events storage key it is considered a match).
	/// Example: for balance tracking on Polkadot & Kusama you would likely want
	/// to track changes to account balances with the frame_system::Account storage item,
	/// which is a map from `AccountId` to `AccountInfo`. The key filter for this would be
	/// the storage prefix for the map:
	/// `26aa394eea5630e07c48ae0c9558cef7b99d880ec681799c0cf30e8886371da9`
	/// - `methods` (param index 3): String of comma separated (no spaces) tracing event method.
	/// If an empty string is specified no events will be filtered out. If anything other than
	/// an empty string is specified, events will be filtered by method (so non-method events will
	/// **not** show up).
	///
	/// Additionally you would want to track the extrinsic index, which is under the
	/// `:extrinsic_index` key. The key for this would be the aforementioned string as bytes
	/// in hex: `3a65787472696e7369635f696e646578`.
	/// The following are some resources to learn more about storage keys in substrate:
	/// [substrate storage][1], [transparent keys in substrate][2],
	/// [querying substrate storage via rpc][3].
	///
	/// [1]: https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/storage#storage-map-keys
	/// [2]: https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate/transparent-keys-in-substrate/
	/// [3]: https://www.shawntabrizi.com/substrate/querying-substrate-storage-via-rpc/
	///
	/// ### Maximum payload size
	///
	/// The maximum payload size allowed is 15mb. Payloads over this size will return a
	/// object with a simple error message. If you run into issues with payload size you can
	/// narrow down the traces using a smaller set of targets and/or storage keys.
	///
	/// If you are having issues with maximum payload size you can use the flag
	/// `-lstate_tracing=trace` to get some logging during tracing.
