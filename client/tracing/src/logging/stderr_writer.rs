//! This module contains a buffered semi-asynchronous stderr writer.
//!
//! Depending on how we were started writing to stderr can take a surprisingly long time.
//!
//! If the other side takes their sweet sweet time reading whatever we send them then writing
//! to stderr might block for a long time, since it is effectively a synchronous operation.
//! And every time we write to stderr we need to grab a global lock, which affects every thread
//! which also tries to log something at the same time.
//!
//! Of course we *will* be ultimately limited by how fast the recipient can ingest our logs,
//! but it's not like logging is the only thing we're doing. And we still can't entirely
//! avoid the problem of multiple threads contending for the same lock. (Well, technically
//! we could employ something like a lock-free circular buffer, but that might be like
//! killing a fly with a sledgehammer considering the complexity involved; this is only
//! a logger after all.)
//!
//! But we can try to make things a little better. We can offload actually writing to stderr
//! to another thread and flush the logs in bulk instead of doing it per-line, which should
//! reduce the amount of CPU time we waste on making syscalls and on spinning waiting for locks.
//!
//! How much this helps depends on a multitude of factors, including the hardware we're running on,
//! how much we're logging, from how many threads, which exact set of threads are logging, to what
//! stderr is actually connected to (is it a terminal emulator? a file? an UDP socket?), etc.
//!
//! In general this can reduce the real time execution time as much as 75% in certain cases, or it
//! can make absolutely no difference in others.
