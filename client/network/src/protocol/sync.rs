//! Contains the state of the chain synchronization process
//!
//! At any given point in time, a running node tries as much as possible to be at the head of the
//! chain. This module handles the logic of which blocks to request from remotes, and processing
//! responses. It yields blocks to check and potentially move to the database.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The `ChainSync` struct maintains the state of the block requests. Whenever something happens on
//! the network, or whenever a block has been successfully verified, call the appropriate method in
//! order to update it.
