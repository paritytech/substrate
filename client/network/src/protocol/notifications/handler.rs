//! Implementations of the `IntoProtocolsHandler` and `ProtocolsHandler` traits for both incoming
//! and outgoing substreams for all gossiping protocols.
//!
//! This is the main implementation of `ProtocolsHandler` in this crate, that handles all the
//! gossiping protocols that are Substrate-related and outside of the scope of libp2p.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! From an API perspective, for each of its protocols, the [`NotifsHandler`] is always in one of
//! the following state (see [`State`]):
//!
//! - Closed substream. This is the initial state.
//! - Closed substream, but remote desires them to be open.
//! - Open substream.
//! - Open substream, but remote desires them to be closed.
//!
//! Each protocol in the [`NotifsHandler`] can spontaneously switch between these states:
//!
//! - "Closed substream" to "Closed substream but open desired". When that happens, a
//! [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenDesiredByRemote`] is emitted.
//! - "Closed substream but open desired" to "Closed substream" (i.e. the remote has cancelled
//! their request). When that happens, a [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseDesired`] is emitted.
//! - "Open substream" to "Open substream but close desired". When that happens, a
//! [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseDesired`] is emitted.
//!
//! The user can instruct a protocol in the `NotifsHandler` to switch from "closed" to "open" or
//! vice-versa by sending either a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] or a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Close`]. The
//! `NotifsHandler` must answer with [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultOk`] or
//! [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultErr`], or with [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseResult`].
//!
//! When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultOk`] is emitted, the substream is now in the open state.
//! When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenResultErr`] or [`NotifsHandlerOut::CloseResult`] is emitted,
//! the `NotifsHandler` is now (or remains) in the closed state.
//!
//! When a [`NotifsHandlerOut::OpenDesiredByRemote`] is emitted, the user should always send back
//! either a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] or a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Close`].If this isn't done, the
//! remote will be left in a pending state.
//!
//! It is illegal to send a [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] before a previously-emitted
//! [`NotifsHandlerIn::Open`] has gotten an answer.
