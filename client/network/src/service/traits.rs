	/// Obtains a [`NotificationSender`] for a connected peer, if it exists.
	///
	/// A `NotificationSender` is scoped to a particular connection to the peer that holds
	/// a receiver. With a `NotificationSender` at hand, sending a notification is done in two
	/// steps:
	///
	/// 1.  [`NotificationSender::ready`] is used to wait for the sender to become ready
	/// for another notification, yielding a [`NotificationSenderReady`] token.
	/// 2.  [`NotificationSenderReady::send`] enqueues the notification for sending. This operation
	/// can only fail if the underlying notification substream or connection has suddenly closed.
	///
	/// An error is returned by [`NotificationSenderReady::send`] if there exists no open
	/// notifications substream with that combination of peer and protocol, or if the remote
	/// has asked to close the notifications substream. If that happens, it is guaranteed that an
	/// [`Event::NotificationStreamClosed`] has been generated on the stream returned by
	/// [`NetworkEventStream::event_stream`].
	///
	/// If the remote requests to close the notifications substream, all notifications successfully
	/// enqueued using [`NotificationSenderReady::send`] will finish being sent out before the
	/// substream actually gets closed, but attempting to enqueue more notifications will now
	/// return an error. It is however possible for the entire connection to be abruptly closed,
	/// in which case enqueued notifications will be lost.
	///
	/// The protocol must have been registered with
	/// `crate::config::NetworkConfiguration::notifications_protocols`.
	///
	/// # Usage
	///
	/// This method returns a struct that allows waiting until there is space available in the
	/// buffer of messages towards the given peer. If the peer processes notifications at a slower
	/// rate than we send them, this buffer will quickly fill up.
	///
	/// As such, you should never do something like this:
	///
	/// ```ignore
	/// // Do NOT do this
	/// for peer in peers {
	/// 	if let Ok(n) = network.notification_sender(peer, ...) {
	/// 			if let Ok(s) = n.ready().await {
	/// 				let _ = s.send(...);
	/// 			}
	/// 	}
	/// }
	/// ```
	///
	/// Doing so would slow down all peers to the rate of the slowest one. A malicious or
	/// malfunctioning peer could intentionally process notifications at a very slow rate.
	///
	/// Instead, you are encouraged to maintain your own buffer of notifications on top of the one
	/// maintained by `sc-network`, and use `notification_sender` to progressively send out
	/// elements from your buffer. If this additional buffer is full (which will happen at some
	/// point if the peer is too slow to process notifications), appropriate measures can be taken,
	/// such as removing non-critical notifications from the buffer or disconnecting the peer
	/// using [`NetworkPeers::disconnect_peer`].
	///
	///
	/// Notifications              Per-peer buffer
	///   broadcast    +------->   of notifications   +-->  `notification_sender`  +-->  Internet
	///                    ^       (not covered by

	///                    +
	///      Notifications should be dropped
