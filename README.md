Dear contributors and users,

We would like to inform you that we have recently made significant changes to our repository structure. In order to streamline our development process and foster better contributions, we have merged three separate repositories Cumulus, Substrate and Polkadot into a single new repository: [the Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk). Go ahead and make sure to support us by giving a star ⭐️ to the new repo.

By consolidating our codebase, we aim to enhance collaboration and provide a more efficient platform for future development.

If you currently have an open pull request in any of the merged repositories, we kindly request that you resubmit your PR in the new repository. This will ensure that your contributions are considered within the updated context and enable us to review and merge them more effectively.

We appreciate your understanding and ongoing support throughout this transition. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to [reach out to us](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/psa-parity-is-currently-working-on-merging-the-polkadot-stack-repositories-into-one-single-repository/2883).

Best Regards,

Parity Technologies
