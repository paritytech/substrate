//! # Recovery Pallet
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Recovery pallet is an M-of-N social recovery tool for users to gain
//! access to their accounts if the private key or other authentication mechanism
//! is lost. Through this pallet, a user is able to make calls on-behalf-of another
//! account which they have recovered. The recovery process is protected by trusted
//! "friends" whom the original account owner chooses. A threshold (M) out of N
//! friends are needed to give another account access to the recoverable account.
//!
//! ### Recovery Configuration
//!
//! The recovery process for each recoverable account can be configured by the account owner.
//! They are able to choose:
//! * `friends` - The list of friends that the account owner trusts to protect the
//!   recovery process for their account.
//! * `threshold` - The number of friends that need to approve a recovery process for
//!   the account to be successfully recovered.
//! * `delay_period` - The minimum number of blocks after the beginning of the recovery
//!   process that need to pass before the account can be successfully recovered.
//!
//! There is a configurable deposit that all users need to pay to create a recovery
//! configuration. This deposit is composed of a base deposit plus a multiplier for
//! the number of friends chosen. This deposit is returned in full when the account
//! owner removes their recovery configuration.
//!
//! ### Recovery Life Cycle
//!
//! The intended life cycle of a successful recovery takes the following steps:
//! 1. The account owner calls `create_recovery` to set up a recovery configuration
//!    for their account.
//! 2. At some later time, the account owner loses access to their account and wants
//!    to recover it. Likely, they will need to create a new account and fund it with
//!    enough balance to support the transaction fees and the deposit for the
//!    recovery process.
//! 3. Using this new account, they call `initiate_recovery`.
//! 4. Then the account owner would contact their configured friends to vouch for
//!    the recovery attempt. The account owner would provide their old account id
//!    and the new account id, and friends would call `vouch_recovery` with those
//!    parameters.
//! 5. Once a threshold number of friends have vouched for the recovery attempt,
//!    the account owner needs to wait until the delay period has passed, starting
//!    when they initiated the recovery process.
//! 6. Now the account owner is able to call `claim_recovery`, which subsequently
//!    allows them to call `as_recovered` and directly make calls on-behalf-of the lost
//!    account.
//! 7. Using the now recovered account, the account owner can call `close_recovery`
//!    on the recovery process they opened, reclaiming the recovery deposit they
//!    placed.
//! 8. Then the account owner should then call `remove_recovery` to remove the recovery
//!    configuration on the recovered account and reclaim the recovery configuration
//!    deposit they placed.
//! 9. Using `as_recovered`, the account owner is able to call any other pallets
//!    to clean up their state and reclaim any reserved or locked funds. They
//!    can then transfer all funds from the recovered account to the new account.
//! 10. When the recovered account becomes reaped (i.e. its free and reserved
//!     balance drops to zero), the final recovery link is removed.
//!
//! ### Malicious Recovery Attempts
//!
//! Initializing a the recovery process for a recoverable account is open and
//! permissionless. However, the recovery deposit is an economic deterrent that
//! should disincentivize would-be attackers from trying to maliciously recover
//! accounts.
//!
//! The recovery deposit can always be claimed by the account which is trying to
//! to be recovered. In the case of a malicious recovery attempt, the account
//! owner who still has access to their account can claim the deposit and
//! essentially punish the malicious user.
//!
//! Furthermore, the malicious recovery attempt can only be successful if the
//! attacker is also able to get enough friends to vouch for the recovery attempt.
//! In the case where the account owner prevents a malicious recovery process,
//! this pallet makes it near-zero cost to re-configure the recovery settings and
//! remove/replace friends who are acting inappropriately.
//!
//! ### Safety Considerations
//!
//! It is important to note that this is a powerful pallet that can compromise the
//! security of an account if used incorrectly. Some recommended practices for users
//! of this pallet are:
//!
//! * Configure a significant `delay_period` for your recovery process: As long as you
//!   have access to your recoverable account, you need only check the blockchain once
//!   every `delay_period` blocks to ensure that no recovery attempt is successful
//!   against your account. Using off-chain notification systems can help with this,
//!   but ultimately, setting a large `delay_period` means that even the most skilled
//!   attacker will need to wait this long before they can access your account.
//! * Use a high threshold of approvals: Setting a value of 1 for the threshold means
//!   that any of your friends would be able to recover your account. They would
//!   simply need to start a recovery process and approve their own process. Similarly,
//!   a threshold of 2 would mean that any 2 friends could work together to gain
//!   access to your account. The only way to prevent against these kinds of attacks
//!   is to choose a high threshold of approvals and select from a diverse friend
//!   group that would not be able to reasonably coordinate with one another.
//! * Reset your configuration over time: Since the entire deposit of creating a
//!   recovery configuration is returned to the user, the only cost of updating
//!   your recovery configuration is the transaction fees for the calls. Thus,
//!   it is strongly encouraged to regularly update your recovery configuration
//!   as your life changes and your relationship with new and existing friends
//!   change as well.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### For General Users
//!
//! * `create_recovery` - Create a recovery configuration for your account and make it recoverable.
//! * `initiate_recovery` - Start the recovery process for a recoverable account.
//!
//! #### For Friends of a Recoverable Account
//! * `vouch_recovery` - As a `friend` of a recoverable account, vouch for a recovery attempt on the account.
//!
//! #### For a User Who Successfully Recovered an Account
//!
//! * `claim_recovery` - Claim access to the account that you have successfully completed the recovery process for.
//! * `as_recovered` - Send a transaction as an account that you have recovered. See other functions below.
//!
//! #### For the Recoverable Account
//!
//! * `close_recovery` - Close an active recovery process for your account and reclaim the recovery deposit.
//! * `remove_recovery` - Remove the recovery configuration from the account, making it un-recoverable.
//!
//! #### For Super Users
//!
//! * `set_recovered` - The ROOT origin is able to skip the recovery process and directly allow
//!   one account to access another.
