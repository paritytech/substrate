//! Implementation of a "bags list": a semi-sorted list where ordering granularity is dictated by

//! data structures, where multiple storage items are masked by one outer API. See
//! [`crate::ListNodes`], [`crate::ListBags`] for more information.

//! The outer API of this module is the [`List`] struct. It wraps all acceptable operations on top
//! of the aggregate linked list. All operations with the bags list should happen through this
