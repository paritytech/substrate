//! # Bags-List Pallet
//!
//! A semi-sorted list, where items hold an `AccountId` based on some `VoteWeight`. The `AccountId`
//! (`id` for short) might be synonym to a `voter` or `nominator` in some context, and `VoteWeight`
//! signifies the chance of each id being included in the final [`SortedListProvider::iter`].
//!
//! It implements [`frame_election_provider_support::SortedListProvider`] to provide a semi-sorted
//! list of accounts to another pallet. It needs some other pallet to give it some information about
//! the weights of accounts via [`frame_election_provider_support::VoteWeightProvider`].
//!
//! This pallet is not configurable at genesis. Whoever uses it should call appropriate functions of
//! the `SortedListProvider` (e.g. `on_insert`, or `unsafe_regenerate`) at their genesis.
//!
//! # Goals
//!
//! The data structure exposed by this pallet aims to be optimized for:
//!
//! - insertions and removals.
//! - iteration over the top* N items by weight, where the precise ordering of items doesn't
//!   particularly matter.
//!
//! # Details
//!
//! - items are kept in bags, which are delineated by their range of weight (See
//!   [`Config::BagThresholds`]).
//! - for iteration, bags are chained together from highest to lowest and elements within the bag
//!   are iterated from head to tail.
//! - items within a bag are iterated in order of insertion. Thus removing an item and re-inserting
//!   it will worsen its position in list iteration; this reduces incentives for some types of spam
//!   that involve consistently removing and inserting for better position. Further, ordering
//!   granularity is thus dictated by range between each bag threshold.
//! - if an item's weight changes to a value no longer within the range of its current bag the
//!   item's position will need to be updated by an external actor with rebag (update), or removal
//!   and insertion.

		/// Ids are separated into unsorted bags according to their vote weight. This specifies the
		/// thresholds separating the bags. An id's bag is the largest bag for which the id's weight
		/// is less than or equal to its upper threshold.
		///
		/// When ids are iterated, higher bags are iterated completely before lower bags. This means
		/// that iteration is _semi-sorted_: ids of higher weight tend to come before ids of lower
		/// weight, but peer ids within a particular bag are sorted in insertion order.
		///
		/// # Expressing the constant
		///
		/// This constant must be sorted in strictly increasing order. Duplicate items are not
		/// permitted.
		///
		/// There is an implied upper limit of `VoteWeight::MAX`; that value does not need to be
		/// specified within the bag. For any two threshold lists, if one ends with
		/// `VoteWeight::MAX`, the other one does not, and they are otherwise equal, the two lists
		/// will behave identically.
		///
		/// # Calculation
		///
		/// It is recommended to generate the set of thresholds in a geometric series, such that
		/// there exists some constant ratio such that `threshold[k + 1] == (threshold[k] *
		/// constant_ratio).max(threshold[k] + 1)` for all `k`.
		///
		/// The helpers in the `/utils/frame/generate-bags` module can simplify this calculation.
		///
		/// # Examples
		///
		/// - If `BagThresholds::get().is_empty()`, then all ids are put into the same bag, and
		///   iteration is strictly in insertion order.
		/// - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 64`, and the thresholds are determined according to
		///   the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is equal to 2.
		/// - If `BagThresholds::get().len() == 200`, and the thresholds are determined according to
		///   the procedure given above, then the constant ratio is approximately equal to 1.248.
		/// - If the threshold list begins `[1, 2, 3, ...]`, then an id with weight 0 or 1 will fall
		///   into bag 0, an id with weight 2 will fall into bag 1, etc.
		///
		/// # Migration
		///
		/// In the event that this list ever changes, a copy of the old bags list must be retained.
		/// With that `List::migrate` can be called, which will perform the appropriate migration.
