//! # Offchain Worker Example Pallet
//!
//! The Ping-Pong Offchain Worker Example: A simple pallet demonstrating concepts, APIs and
//! structures common to most offchain workers.
//!
//! Run `cargo doc --package pallet-example-offchain-worker-ping-pong --open` to view this module's
//! documentation.
//!
//! **This pallet serves as an example showcasing Substrate off-chain worker and is not meant to be
//! used in production.**
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This is a simple example pallet to showcase how the runtime can and should interact with an
//! offchain worker asynchronously. It also showcases the potential pitfalls and security
//! considerations that come with it.
//!
//! It is based on [this example by
//! `gnunicorn`](https://gnunicorn.github.io/substrate-offchain-cb/), although an updated version
//! with a few modifications.
//!
//! The example plays simple ping-pong with off-chain workers: Once a signed transaction to `ping`
//! is submitted (by any user), a Ping request is written into Storage. Each Ping request has a
//! `nonce`, which is arbitrarily chosen by the user (not necessarily unique).
//!
//! After every block, the offchain worker is triggered. If it sees a Ping request in the current
//! block, it reacts by sending a transaction to send a Pong with the corresponding `nonce`. When
//! `pong_*` extrinsics are executed, they emit an `PongAck*` event so we can track with existing
//! UIs.
//!
//! The `PongAck*` events come in two different flavors:
//! - `PongAckAuthenticated`: emitted when the call was made by an **authenticated** offchain worker
//!   (whitelisted via `Authorities` storage)
//! - `PongAckUnauthenticated`: emitted when the call was made by an **unauthenticated** offchain
//!   worker (or potentially malicious actors
//!
//! The security implications from `PongAckUnauthenticated` should be obvious: not **ONLY** offchain
//! workers can call `pong_unsigned*`. **ANYONE** can do it, and they can actually use a different
//! `nonce` from the original ping (try it yourself!). If the `nonce` actually had some important
//! meaning to the state of our chain, this would be a **VULNERABILITY**.
//!
//! Also, unsigned transactions can easily become a vector for DoS attacks!
//!
//! This is meant to highlight the importance of solid security assumptions when using unsigned
//! transactions. In other words:
//!
//! ⚠️ **DO NOT USE UNSIGNED TRANSACTIONS UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING!** ⚠️
//!
//! Here's an example of how a node admin can inject some keys into the keystore, so that the OCW
//! can call `pong_signed`:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9944' \
//! --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
//! --data-raw '{
//!     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
//!     "method": "author_insertKey",
//!     "params": [
//!       "pong", 
//!       "bread tongue spell stadium clean grief coin rent spend total practice document", 
//!       "0xb6a8b4b6bf796991065035093d3265e314c3fe89e75ccb623985e57b0c2e0c30"
//!     ],
//!     "id": 1
//! }'
//! ```
//!
//! Then make sure that the corresponding address
//! (`5GCCgshTQCfGkXy6kAkFDW1TZXAdsbCNZJ9Uz2c7ViBnwcVg`) has funds and is added to `Authorities` in
//! the runtime by adding it via `add_authority` extrinsic (from `root`).
//!
//! More complex management models and session based key rotations should be considered, but that's
//! outside the scope of this example.
