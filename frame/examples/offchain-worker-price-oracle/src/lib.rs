//! # Price Oracle Offchain Worker Example Pallet
//!
//! The Price Oracle Offchain Worker Example: A simple pallet demonstrating concepts, APIs and
//! structures common to most offchain workers.
//!
//! Run `cargo doc --package pallet-example-offchain-worker-price-oracle --open` to view this
//! module's documentation.
//!
//! **This pallet serves as an example showcasing Substrate off-chain worker and is not meant to be
//! used in production.**
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! In this example we are going to build a very simplistic, naive and definitely NOT
//! production-ready oracle for BTC/USD price. The main goal is to showcase how to use off-chain
//! workers to fetch data from external sources via HTTP and feed it back on-chain.
//!
//! The OCW will be triggered after every block, fetch the current price and prepare either signed
//! or unsigned transaction to feed the result back on chain. The on-chain logic will simply
//! aggregate the results and store last `64` values to compute the average price.
//!
//! Only authorized keys are allowed to submit the price. The authorization key should be rotated.
//!
//! Here's an example of how a node admin can inject some keys into the keystore:
//!
//! ```bash
//! $ curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9944' \
//! --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
//! --data-raw '{
//!     "jsonrpc": "2.0",
//!     "method": "author_insertKey",
//!     "params": [
//!	      "btc!", 
//!       "bread tongue spell stadium clean grief coin rent spend total practice document", 
//!       "0xb6a8b4b6bf796991065035093d3265e314c3fe89e75ccb623985e57b0c2e0c30"
//!     ],
//!     "id": 1
//! }'
//! ```
//!
//! Then make sure that the corresponding address
//! (`5GCCgshTQCfGkXy6kAkFDW1TZXAdsbCNZJ9Uz2c7ViBnwcVg`) has funds and is added to `Authorities` in
//! the runtime by adding it via `add_authority` extrinsic (from `root`).
//!
//! More complex management models and session based key rotations should be considered, but thatâ€™s
//! outside the scope of this example.
