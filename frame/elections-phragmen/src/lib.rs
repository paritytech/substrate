//! # Phragmén Election Module.
//!
//! An election module based on sequential phragmen.
//!
//! ### Term and Round
//!
//! The election happens in _rounds_: every `N` blocks, all previous members are retired and a new
//! set is elected (which may or may not have an intersection with the previous set). Each round
//! lasts for some number of blocks defined by [`Config::TermDuration`]. The words _term_ and
//! _round_ can be used interchangeably in this context.
//!
//! [`Config::TermDuration`] might change during a round. This can shorten or extend the length of
//! the round. The next election round's block number is never stored but rather always checked on
//! the fly. Based on the current block number and [`Config::TermDuration`], the condition
//! `BlockNumber % TermDuration == 0` being satisfied will always trigger a new election round.
//!
//! ### Bonds and Deposits
//!
//! Both voting and being a candidate requires deposits to be taken, in exchange for the data that
//! needs to be kept on-chain. The terms *bond* and *deposit* can be used interchangeably in this
//! context.
//!
//! Bonds will be unreserved only upon adhering to the protocol laws. Failing to do so will cause in
//! the bond to slashed.
//!
//! ### Voting
//!
//! Voters can vote for a limited number of the candidates by providing a list of account ids,
//! bounded by [`MAXIMUM_VOTE`]. Invalid votes (voting for non-candidates) and duplicate votes are
//! ignored during election. Yet, a voter _might_ vote for a future candidate. Voters reserve a bond
//! as they vote. Each vote defines a `value`. This amount is locked from the account of the voter
//! and indicates the weight of the vote. Voters can update their votes at any time by calling
//! `vote()` again. This can update the vote targets (which might update the deposit) or update the
//! vote's stake ([`Voter::stake`]). After a round, votes are kept and might still be valid for
//! further rounds. A voter is responsible for calling `remove_voter` once they are done to have
//! their bond back and remove the lock.
//!
//! See [`Call::vote`], [`Call::remove_voter`].
//!
//! ### Defunct Voter
//!
//! A voter is defunct once all of the candidates that they have voted for are not a valid candidate
//! (as seen further below, members and runners-up are also always candidates). Defunct voters can
//! be removed via a root call ([`Call::clean_defunct_voters`]). Upon being removed, their bond is
//! returned. This is an administrative operation and can be called only by the root origin in the
//! case of state bloat.
//!
//! ### Candidacy and Members
//!
//! Candidates also reserve a bond as they submit candidacy. A candidate can end up in one of the
//! below situations:
//!   - **Members**: A winner is kept as a _member_. They must still have a bond in reserve and they
//!     are automatically counted as a candidate for the next election. The number of desired
//!     members is set by [`Config::DesiredMembers`].
//!   - **Runner-up**: Runners-up are the best candidates immediately after the winners. The number
//!     of runners up to keep is set by [`Config::DesiredRunnersUp`]. Runners-up are used, in the
//!     same order as they are elected, as replacements when a candidate is kicked by
//!     [`Call::remove_member`], or when an active member renounces their candidacy. Runners are
//!     automatically counted as a candidate for the next election.
//!   - **Loser**: Any of the candidate who are not member/runner-up are left as losers. A loser
//!     might be an _outgoing member or runner-up_, meaning that they are an active member who
//!     failed to keep their spot. **An outgoing candidate/member/runner-up will always lose their
//!     bond**.
//!
//! #### Renouncing candidacy.
//!
//! All candidates, elected or not, can renounce their candidacy. A call to
//! [`Call::renounce_candidacy`] will always cause the candidacy bond to be refunded.
//!
//! Note that with the members being the default candidates for the next round and votes persisting
//! in storage, the election system is entirely stable given no further input. This means that if
//! the system has a particular set of candidates `C` and voters `V` that lead to a set of members
//! `M` being elected, as long as `V` and `C` don't remove their candidacy and votes, `M` will keep
//! being re-elected at the end of each round.
//!
