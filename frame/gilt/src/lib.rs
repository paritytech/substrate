//! # Gilt Pallet
//! A pallet allowing accounts to auction for being frozen and receive open-ended
//! inflation-protection in return.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Lock up tokens, for at least as long as you offer, and be free from both inflation and
//! intermediate reward or exchange until the tokens become unlocked.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! Queues for each of 1-`QueueCount` periods, given in blocks (`Period`). Queues are limited in
//! size to something sensible, `MaxQueueLen`. A secondary storage item with `QueueCount` x `u32`
//! elements with the number of items in each queue.
//!
//! Queues are split into two parts. The first part is a priority queue based on bid size. The
//! second part is just a FIFO (the size of the second part is set with `FifoQueueLen`). Items are
//! always prepended so that removal is always O(1) since removal often happens many times under a
//! single weighed function (`on_initialize`) yet placing bids only ever happens once per weighed
//! function (`place_bid`). If the queue has a priority portion, then it remains sorted in order of
//! bid size so that smaller bids fall off as it gets too large.
//!
//! Account may enqueue a balance with some number of `Period`s lock up, up to a maximum of
//! `QueueCount`. The balance gets reserved. There's a minimum of `MinFreeze` to avoid dust.
//!
//! Until your bid is turned into an issued gilt you can retract it instantly and the funds are
//! unreserved.
//!
//! There's a target proportion of effective total issuance (i.e. accounting for existing gilts)
//! which the we attempt to have frozen at any one time. It will likely be gradually increased over
//! time by governance.
//!
//! As the total funds frozen under gilts drops below `FrozenFraction` of the total effective
//! issuance, then bids are taken from queues, with the queue of the greatest period taking
//! priority. If the item in the queue's locked amount is greater than the amount left to be
//! frozen, then it is split up into multiple bids and becomes partially frozen under gilt.
//!
//! Once an account's balance is frozen, it remains frozen until the owner thaws the balance of the
//! account. This may happen no earlier than queue's period after the point at which the gilt is
//! issued.
//!
//! ## Suggested Values
//!
//! - `QueueCount`: 300
//! - `Period`: 432,000
//! - `MaxQueueLen`: 1000
//! - `MinFreeze`: Around CHF 100 in value.
