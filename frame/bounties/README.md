# Bounties Module ( pallet-bounties )

## Bounty

> NOTE: This pallet is tightly coupled with pallet-treasury.

A Bounty Spending is a reward for a specified body of work - or specified set of objectives -
that needs to be executed for a predefined Treasury amount to be paid out. A curator is assigned
after the bounty is approved and funded by Council, to be delegated with the responsibility of
assigning a payout address once the specified set of objectives is completed.

After the Council has activated a bounty, it delegates the work that requires expertise to a
curator in exchange of a deposit. Once the curator accepts the bounty, they get to close the
active bounty. Closing the active bounty enacts a delayed payout to the payout address, the
curator fee and the return of the curator deposit. The delay allows for intervention through
regular democracy. The Council gets to unassign the curator, resulting in a new curator
election. The Council also gets to cancel the bounty if deemed necessary before assigning a
curator or once the bounty is active or payout is pending, resulting in the slash of the
curator's deposit.

This pallet may opt into using a [`ChildBountyManager`] that enables bounties to be split into
sub-bounties, as children of anh established bounty (called the parent in the context of it's
children).

> NOTE: The parent bounty cannot be closed if it has a non-zero number of it has active child
> bounties associated with it.
