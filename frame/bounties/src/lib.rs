//! # Bounties Module ( pallet-bounties )
//!
//! ## Bounty
//!
//! > NOTE: This pallet is tightly coupled with pallet-treasury.
//!
//! A Bounty Spending is a reward for a specified body of work - or specified set of objectives -
//! that needs to be executed for a predefined Treasury amount to be paid out. A curator is assigned
//! after the bounty is approved and funded by Council, to be delegated with the responsibility of
//! assigning a payout address once the specified set of objectives is completed.
//!
//! After the Council has activated a bounty, it delegates the work that requires expertise to a
//! curator in exchange of a deposit. Once the curator accepts the bounty, they get to close the
//! active bounty. Closing the active bounty enacts a delayed payout to the payout address, the
//! curator fee and the return of the curator deposit. The delay allows for intervention through
//! regular democracy. The Council gets to unassign the curator, resulting in a new curator
//! election. The Council also gets to cancel the bounty if deemed necessary before assigning a
//! curator or once the bounty is active or payout is pending, resulting in the slash of the
//! curator's deposit.
//!
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! Bounty:
//! - **Bounty spending proposal:** A proposal to reward a predefined body of work upon completion
//!   by the Treasury.
//! - **Proposer:** An account proposing a bounty spending.
//! - **Curator:** An account managing the bounty and assigning a payout address receiving the
//!   reward for the completion of work.
//! - **Deposit:** The amount held on deposit for placing a bounty proposal plus the amount held on
//!   deposit per byte within the bounty description.
//! - **Curator deposit:** The payment from a candidate willing to curate an approved bounty. The
//!   deposit is returned when/if the bounty is completed.
//! - **Bounty value:** The total amount that should be paid to the Payout Address if the bounty is
//!   rewarded.
//! - **Payout address:** The account to which the total or part of the bounty is assigned to.
//! - **Payout Delay:** The delay period for which a bounty beneficiary needs to wait before
//!   claiming.
//! - **Curator fee:** The reserved upfront payment for a curator for work related to the bounty.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! Bounty protocol:
//! - `propose_bounty` - Propose a specific treasury amount to be earmarked for a predefined set of
//!   tasks and stake the required deposit.
//! - `approve_bounty` - Accept a specific treasury amount to be earmarked for a predefined body of
//!   work.
//! - `propose_curator` - Assign an account to a bounty as candidate curator.
//! - `accept_curator` - Accept a bounty assignment from the Council, setting a curator deposit.
//! - `extend_bounty_expiry` - Extend the expiry block number of the bounty and stay active.
//! - `award_bounty` - Close and pay out the specified amount for the completed work.
//! - `claim_bounty` - Claim a specific bounty amount from the Payout Address.
//! - `unassign_curator` - Unassign an accepted curator from a specific earmark.
//! - `close_bounty` - Cancel the earmark for a specific treasury amount and close the bounty.
