//! GRANDPA Consensus module for runtime.
//!
//! This manages the GRANDPA authority set ready for the native code.
//! These authorities are only for GRANDPA finality, not for consensus overall.
//!
//! In the future, it will also handle misbehavior reports, and on-chain
//! finality notifications.
//!
//! For full integration with GRANDPA, the `GrandpaApi` should be implemented.
//! The necessary items are re-exported via the `fg_primitives` crate.

#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std)]
