//! # Scored Pool Pallet
//!
//! The pallet maintains a scored membership pool. Each entity in the
//! pool can be attributed a `Score`. From this pool a set `Members`
//! is constructed. This set contains the `MemberCount` highest
//! scoring entities. Unscored entities are never part of `Members`.
//!
//! If an entity wants to be part of the pool a deposit is required.
//! The deposit is returned when the entity withdraws or when it
//! is removed by an entity with the appropriate authority.
//!
//! Every `Period` blocks the set of `Members` is refreshed from the
//! highest scoring members in the pool and, no matter if changes
//! occurred, `T::MembershipChanged::set_members_sorted` is invoked.
//! On first load `T::MembershipInitialized::initialize_members` is
//! invoked with the initial `Members` set.
//!
//! It is possible to withdraw candidacy/resign your membership at any
//! time. If an entity is currently a member, this results in removal
//! from the `Pool` and `Members`; the entity is immediately replaced
//! by the next highest scoring candidate in the pool, if available.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - `submit_candidacy` - Submit candidacy to become a member. Requires a deposit.
//! - `withdraw_candidacy` - Withdraw candidacy. Deposit is returned.
//! - `score` - Attribute a quantitative score to an entity.
//! - `kick` - Remove an entity from the pool and members. Deposit is returned.
//! - `change_member_count` - Changes the amount of candidates taken into `Members`.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use pallet_scored_pool::{self as scored_pool};
//!
//! #[frame_support::pallet]
//! pub mod pallet {
//! 	use super::*;
//! 	use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
//! 	use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;
//!
//! 	#[pallet::pallet]
//! 	pub struct Pallet<T>(_);
//!
//! 	#[pallet::config]
//! 	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + scored_pool::Config {}
//!
//! 	#[pallet::call]
//! 	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
//! 		#[pallet::weight(0)]
//! 		pub fn candidate(origin: OriginFor<T>) -> DispatchResult {
//! 			let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//!
//! 			let _ = <scored_pool::Pallet<T>>::submit_candidacy(
//! 				T::Origin::from(Some(who.clone()).into())
//! 			);
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//!
//! This pallet depends on the [System pallet](../frame_system/index.html).

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
