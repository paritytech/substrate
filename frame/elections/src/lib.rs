// no polynomial attacks:
//
// all unbonded public operations should be constant time.
// all other public operations must be linear time in terms of prior public operations and:
// - those "valid" ones that cost nothing be limited to a constant number per single protected
//   operation
// - the rest costing the same order as the computational complexity
// all protected operations must complete in at most O(public operations)
//
// we assume "beneficial" transactions will have the same access as attack transactions.
//
// any storage requirements should be bonded by the same order as the volume.

// public operations:
// - express approvals (you pay in a "voter" bond the first time you do this; O(1); one extra DB
//   entry, one DB change)
// - remove active voter (you get your "voter" bond back; O(1); one fewer DB entry, one DB change)
// - remove inactive voter (either you or the target is removed; if the target, you get their
//   "voter" bond back; O(1); one fewer DB entry, one DB change)
// - submit candidacy (you pay a "candidate" bond; O(1); one extra DB entry, two DB changes)
// - present winner/runner-up (you may pay a "presentation" bond of O(voters) if the presentation
//   is invalid; O(voters) compute; ) protected operations:
// - remove candidacy (remove all votes for a candidate) (one fewer DB entry, two DB changes)

// to avoid a potentially problematic case of not-enough approvals prior to voting causing a
// back-to-back votes that have no way of ending, then there's a forced grace period between votes.
// to keep the system as stateless as possible (making it a bit easier to reason about), we just
// restrict when votes can begin to blocks that lie on boundaries (`voting_period`).

// for an approval vote of C members:

// top K runners-up are maintained between votes. all others are discarded.
// - candidate removed & bond returned when elected.
// - candidate removed & bond burned when discarded.

// at the point that the vote ends (), all voters' balances are snapshotted.

// for B blocks following, there's a counting period whereby each of the candidates that believe
// they fall in the top K+C voted can present themselves. they get the total stake
// recorded (based on the snapshot); an ordered list is maintained (the leaderboard). No one may
// present themselves that, if elected, would result in being included twice in the collective
// (important since existing members will have their approval votes as it may be that they
// don't get removed), nor if existing presenters would mean they're not in the top K+C.

// following B blocks, the top C candidates are elected and have their bond returned. the top C
// candidates and all other candidates beyond the top C+K are cleared.

// vote-clearing happens lazily; for an approval to count, the most recent vote at the time of the
// voter's most recent vote must be no later than the most recent vote at the time that the
// candidate in the approval position was registered there. as candidates are removed from the
// register and others join in their place, this prevents an approval meant for an earlier candidate
// being used to elect a new candidate.

// the candidate list increases as needed, but the contents (though not really the capacity) reduce
// after each vote as all but K entries are cleared. newly registering candidates must use cleared
// entries before they increase the capacity.
