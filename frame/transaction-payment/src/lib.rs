//! # Transaction Payment Pallet
//!
//! This pallet provides the basic logic needed to pay the absolute minimum amount needed for a
//! transaction to be included. This includes:
//!   - _base fee_: This is the minimum amount a user pays for a transaction. It is declared
//! 	as a base _weight_ in the runtime and converted to a fee using `WeightToFee`.
//!   - _weight fee_: A fee proportional to amount of weight a transaction consumes.
//!   - _length fee_: A fee proportional to the encoded length of the transaction.
//!   - _tip_: An optional tip. Tip increases the priority of the transaction, giving it a higher
//!     chance to be included by the transaction queue.
//!
//! The base fee and adjusted weight and length fees constitute the _inclusion fee_, which is
//! the minimum fee for a transaction to be included in a block.
//!
//! The formula of final fee:
//!   ```ignore
//!   inclusion_fee = base_fee + length_fee + [targeted_fee_adjustment * weight_fee];
//!   final_fee = inclusion_fee + tip;
//!   ```
//!
//!   - `targeted_fee_adjustment`: This is a multiplier that can tune the final fee based on
//! 	the congestion of the network.
//!
//! Additionally, this pallet allows one to configure:
//!   - The mapping between one unit of weight to one unit of fee via [`Config::WeightToFee`].
//!   - A means of updating the fee for the next block, via defining a multiplier, based on the
//!     final state of the chain at the end of the previous block. This can be configured via
//!     [`Config::FeeMultiplierUpdate`]
//!   - How the fees are paid via [`Config::OnChargeTransaction`].

/// Multiplier>`, meaning that it can convert the previous multiplier to the next one. This should
/// be called on `on_finalize` of a block, prior to potentially cleaning the weight data from the
/// system pallet.
///
/// given:
/// 	s = previous block weight
/// 	s'= ideal block weight
/// 	m = maximum block weight
/// 		diff = (s - s')/m
/// 		v = 0.00001
/// 		t1 = (v * diff)
/// 		t2 = (v * diff)^2 / 2
/// 	then:
/// 	next_multiplier = prev_multiplier * (1 + t1 + t2)
///
/// Where `(s', v)` must be given as the `Get` implementation of the `T` generic type. Moreover, `M`
/// must provide the minimum allowed value for the multiplier. Note that a runtime should ensure
/// with tests that the combination of this `M` and `V` is not such that the multiplier can drop to
/// zero and never recover.
///
/// Note that `s'` is interpreted as a portion in the _normal transaction_ capacity of the block.
/// For example, given `s' == 0.25` and `AvailableBlockRatio = 0.75`, then the target fullness is
/// _0.25 of the normal capacity_ and _0.1875 of the entire block_.
///
/// Since block weight is multi-dimension, we use the scarcer resource, referred as limiting
/// dimension, for calculation of fees. We determine the limiting dimension by comparing the
/// dimensions using the ratio of `dimension_value / max_dimension_value` and selecting the largest
/// ratio. For instance, if a block is 30% full based on `ref_time` and 25% full based on
/// `proof_size`, we identify `ref_time` as the limiting dimension, indicating that the block is 30%
/// full.
///
/// This implementation implies the bound:
/// - `v ≤ p / k * (s − s')`
/// - or, solving for `p`: `p >= v * k * (s - s')`
///
/// where `p` is the amount of change over `k` blocks.
///
/// Hence:
/// - in a fully congested chain: `p >= v * k * (1 - s')`.
/// - in an empty chain: `p >= v * k * (-s')`.
///
/// For example, when all blocks are full and there are 28800 blocks per day (default in
/// `substrate-node`) and v == 0.00001, s' == 0.1875, we'd have:
///
/// p >= 0.00001 * 28800 * 0.8125
/// p >= 0.234
///
/// Meaning that fees can change by around ~23% per day, given extreme congestion.

	/// `tip * (max_block_{weight|length} / bounded_{weight|length})`, since given current
	/// state of-the-art blockchains, number of per-block transactions is expected to be in a
	/// range reasonable enough to not saturate the `Balance` type while multiplying by the tip.
