//! # Society Pallet
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Society pallet is an economic game which incentivizes users to participate
//! and maintain a membership society.
//!
//! ### User Types
//!
//! At any point, a user in the society can be one of a:
//! * Bidder - A user who has submitted intention of joining the society.
//! * Candidate - A user who will be voted on to join the society.
//! * Suspended Candidate - A user who failed to win a vote.
//! * Member - A user who is a member of the society.
//! * Suspended Member - A member of the society who has accumulated too many strikes
//! or failed their membership challenge.
//!
//! Of the non-suspended members, there is always a:
//! * Head - A member who is exempt from suspension.
//! * Defender - A member whose membership is under question and voted on again.
//!
//! Of the non-suspended members of the society, a random set of them are chosen as
//! "skeptics". The mechanics of skeptics is explained in the
//! [member phase](#member-phase) below.
//!
//! ### Mechanics
//!
//! #### Rewards
//!
//! Members are incentivized to participate in the society through rewards paid
//! by the Society treasury. These payments have a maturity period that the user
//! must wait before they are able to access the funds.
//!
//! #### Punishments
//!
//! Members can be punished by slashing the reward payouts that have not been
//! collected. Additionally, members can accumulate "strikes", and when they
//! reach a max strike limit, they become suspended.
//!
//! #### Skeptics
//!
//! During the voting period, a random set of members are selected as "skeptics".
//! These skeptics are expected to vote on the current candidates. If they do not vote,
//! their skeptic status is treated as a rejection vote, the member is deemed
//! "lazy", and are given a strike per missing vote.
//!
//! #### Membership Challenges
//!
//! Every challenge rotation period, an existing member will be randomly selected
//! to defend their membership into society. Then, other members can vote whether
//! this defender should stay in society. A simple majority wins vote will determine
//! the outcome of the user. Ties are treated as a failure of the challenge, but
//! assuming no one else votes, the defender always get a free vote on their
//! own challenge keeping them in the society. The Head member is exempt from the
//! negative outcome of a membership challenge.
//!
//! #### Society Treasury
//!
//! The membership society is independently funded by a treasury managed by this
//! pallet. Some subset of this treasury is placed in a Society Pot, which is used
//! to determine the number of accepted bids.
//!
//! #### Rate of Growth
//!
//! The membership society can grow at a rate of 10 accepted candidates per rotation period up
//! to the max membership threshold. Once this threshold is met, candidate selections
//! are stalled until there is space for new members to join. This can be resolved by
//! voting out existing members through the random challenges or by using governance
//! to increase the maximum membership count.
//!
//! ### User Life Cycle
//!
//! A user can go through the following phases:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!           +------->  User  <----------+
//!           |           +               |
//!           |           |               |
//! +----------------------------------------------+
//! |         |           |               |        |
//! |         |           v               |        |
//! |         |        Bidder <-----------+        |
//! |         |           +               |        |
//! |         |           |               +        |
//! |         |           v            Suspended   |
//! |         |       Candidate +----> Candidate   |
//! |         |           +               +        |
//! |         |           |               |        |
//! |         +           |               |        |
//! |   Suspended +------>|               |        |
//! |      Member         |               |        |
//! |         ^           |               |        |
//! |         |           v               |        |
//! |         +-------+ Member <----------+        |
//! |                                              |
//! |                                              |
//! +------------------Society---------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! #### Initialization
//!
//! The society is initialized with a single member who is automatically chosen as the Head.
//!
//! #### Bid Phase
//!
//! New users must have a bid to join the society.
//!
//! A user can make a bid by reserving a deposit. Alternatively, an already existing member
//! can create a bid on a user's behalf by "vouching" for them.
//!
//! A bid includes reward information that the user would like to receive for joining
//! the society. A vouching bid can additionally request some portion of that reward as a tip
//! to the voucher for vouching for the prospective candidate.
//!
//! Every rotation period, Bids are ordered by reward amount, and the pallet
//! selects as many bids the Society Pot can support for that period.
//!
//! These selected bids become candidates and move on to the Candidate phase.
//! Bids that were not selected stay in the bidder pool until they are selected or
//! a user chooses to "unbid".
//!
//! #### Candidate Phase
//!
//! Once a bidder becomes a candidate, members vote whether to approve or reject
//! that candidate into society. This voting process also happens during a rotation period.
//!
//! The approval and rejection criteria for candidates are not set on chain,
//! and may change for different societies.
//!
//! At the end of the rotation period, we collect the votes for a candidate
//! and randomly select a vote as the final outcome.
//!
//! ```ignore
//!  [ a-accept, r-reject, s-skeptic ]
//! +----------------------------------+
//! |                                  |
//! |  Member   |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|  |
//! |  -----------------------------   |
//! |  Vote     |a|a|a|r|s|r|a|a|s|a|  |
//! |  -----------------------------   |
//! |  Selected | | | |x| | | | | | |  |
//! |                                  |
//! +----------------------------------+
//!
//! Result: Rejected
//! ```
//!
//! Each member that voted opposite to this randomly selected vote is punished by
//! slashing their unclaimed payouts and increasing the number of strikes they have.
//!
//! These slashed funds are given to a random user who voted the same as the
//! selected vote as a reward for participating in the vote.
//!
//! If the candidate wins the vote, they receive their bid reward as a future payout.
//! If the bid was placed by a voucher, they will receive their portion of the reward,
//! before the rest is paid to the winning candidate.
//!
//! One winning candidate is selected as the Head of the members. This is randomly
//! chosen, weighted by the number of approvals the winning candidates accumulated.
//!
//! If the candidate loses the vote, they are suspended and it is up to the Suspension
//! Judgement origin to determine if the candidate should go through the bidding process
//! again, should be accepted into the membership society, or rejected and their deposit
//! slashed.
//!
//! #### Member Phase
//!
//! Once a candidate becomes a member, their role is to participate in society.
//!
//! Regular participation involves voting on candidates who want to join the membership
//! society, and by voting in the right way, a member will accumulate future payouts.
//! When a payout matures, members are able to claim those payouts.
//!
//! Members can also vouch for users to join the society, and request a "tip" from
//! the fees the new member would collect by joining the society. This vouching
//! process is useful in situations where a user may not have enough balance to
//! satisfy the bid deposit. A member can only vouch one user at a time.
//!
//! During rotation periods, a random group of members are selected as "skeptics".
//! These skeptics are expected to vote on the current candidates. If they do not vote,
//! their skeptic status is treated as a rejection vote, the member is deemed
//! "lazy", and are given a strike per missing vote.
//!
//! There is a challenge period in parallel to the rotation period. During a challenge period,
//! a random member is selected to defend their membership to the society. Other members
//! make a traditional majority-wins vote to determine if the member should stay in the society.
//! Ties are treated as a failure of the challenge.
//!
//! If a member accumulates too many strikes or fails their membership challenge,
//! they will become suspended. While a member is suspended, they are unable to
//! claim matured payouts. It is up to the Suspension Judgement origin to determine
//! if the member should re-enter society or be removed from society with all their
//! future payouts slashed.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### For General Users
//!
//! * `bid` - A user can make a bid to join the membership society by reserving a deposit.
//! * `unbid` - A user can withdraw their bid for entry, the deposit is returned.
//!
//! #### For Members
//!
//! * `vouch` - A member can place a bid on behalf of a user to join the membership society.
//! * `unvouch` - A member can revoke their vouch for a user.
//! * `vote` - A member can vote to approve or reject a candidate's request to join the society.
//! * `defender_vote` - A member can vote to approve or reject a defender's continued membership
//! to the society.
//! * `payout` - A member can claim their first matured payment.
//! * `unfound` - Allow the founder to unfound the society when they are the only member.
//!
//! #### For Super Users
//!
//! * `found` - The founder origin can initiate this society. Useful for bootstrapping the Society
//! pallet on an already running chain.
//! * `judge_suspended_member` - The suspension judgement origin is able to make
//! judgement on a suspended member.
//! * `judge_suspended_candidate` - The suspension judgement origin is able to
//! make judgement on a suspended candidate.
//! * `set_max_membership` - The ROOT origin can update the maximum member count for the society.
//! The max membership count must be greater than 1.
