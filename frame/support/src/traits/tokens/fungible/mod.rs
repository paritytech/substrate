//! The traits for dealing with a single fungible token class and any associated types.
//!
//! ### User-implememted traits
//! - `Inspect`: Regular balance inspector functions.
//! - `Unbalanced`: Low-level balance mutating functions. Does not guarantee proper book-keeping and
//!   so should not be called into directly from application code. Other traits depend on this and
//!   provide default implementations based on it.
//! - `UnbalancedHold`: Low-level balance mutating functions for balances placed on hold. Does not
//!   guarantee proper book-keeping and so should not be called into directly from application code.
//!   Other traits depend on this and provide default implementations based on it.
//! - `Mutate`: Regular balance mutator functions. Pre-implemented using `Unbalanced`, though the
//!   `done_*` functions should likely be reimplemented in case you want to do something following
//!   the operation such as emit events.
//! - `InspectHold`: Inspector functions for balances on hold.
//! - `MutateHold`: Mutator functions for balances on hold. Mostly pre-implemented using
//!   `UnbalancedHold`.
//! - `InspectFreeze`: Inspector functions for frozen balance.
//! - `MutateFreeze`: Mutator functions for frozen balance.
//! - `Balanced`: One-sided mutator functions for regular balances, which return imbalance objects
//!   which guarantee eventual book-keeping. May be useful for some sophisticated operations where
//!   funds must be removed from an account before it is known precisely what should be done with
//!   them.
