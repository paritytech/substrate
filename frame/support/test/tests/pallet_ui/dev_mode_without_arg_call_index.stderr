error: use of deprecated constant `pallet::warnings::ImplicitCallIndex_0::_w`:
               It is deprecated to use implicit call indices.
               Please instead ensure that all calls have a `pallet::call_index` attribute or put the pallet into `dev` mode.

error: use of deprecated constant `pallet::warnings::ConstantWeight_0::_w`:
               It is deprecated to use hard-coded constant as call weight.
               Please instead benchmark all calls or put the pallet into `dev` mode.
