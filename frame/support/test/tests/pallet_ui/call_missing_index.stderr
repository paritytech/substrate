error: use of deprecated struct `pallet::warnings::foo`:
                   Implicit call indices are deprecated in favour of explicit ones.
                   Please ensure that all calls have the `pallet::call_index` attribute or that the
                   `dev-mode` of the pallet is enabled. For more info see:
                   <https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12891> and
