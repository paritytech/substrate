error[E0599]: the function or associated item `max_encoded_len` exists for struct `Generic<NotMel>`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   |                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ function or associated item cannot be called on `Generic<NotMel>` due to unsatisfied trait bounds
   |
   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `NotMel: MaxEncodedLen`
           which is required by `Generic<NotMel>: MaxEncodedLen`
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `max_encoded_len`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `MaxEncodedLen`
