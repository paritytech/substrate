//! # Fast Unstake Pallet
//!
//! A pallet to allow participants of the staking system (represented by [`Config::Staking`], being
//! [`StakingInterface`]) to unstake quicker, if and only if they meet the condition of not being
//! exposed to any slashes.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! If a nominator is not exposed anywhere in the staking system, checked via
//! [`StakingInterface::is_exposed_in_era`] (i.e. "has not actively backed any validators in the
//! last [`StakingInterface::bonding_duration`] days"), then they can register themselves in this
//! pallet and unstake faster than having to wait an entire bonding duration.
//!
//! *Being exposed with validator* from the point of view of the staking system means earning
//! rewards with the validator, and also being at the risk of slashing with the validator. This is
//! equivalent to the "Active Nominator" role explained in
//! [here](https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-february-2022/).
//!
//! Stakers who are certain about NOT being exposed can register themselves with
//! [`Pallet::register_fast_unstake`]. This will chill, fully unbond the staker and place them
//! in the queue to be checked.
//!
//! A successful registration implies being fully unbonded and chilled in the staking system. These
//! effects persist even if the fast-unstake registration is retracted (see [`Pallet::deregister`]
//! and further).
//!
//! Once registered as a fast-unstaker, the staker will be queued and checked by the system. This
//! can take a variable number of blocks based on demand, but will almost certainly be "faster" (as
//! the name suggest) than waiting the standard bonding duration.
//!
//! A fast-unstaker is either in [`Queue`] or actively being checked, at which point it lives in
//! [`Head`]. Once in [`Head`], the request cannot be retracted anymore. But, once in [`Queue`], it
//! can, via [`Pallet::deregister`].
//!
//! A deposit equal to [`Config::Deposit`] is collected for this process, and is returned in case a
//! successful unstake occurs (`Event::Unstaked` signals that).
//!
//! Once processed, if successful, no additional fee for the checking process is taken, and the
//! staker is instantly unbonded.
//!
//! If unsuccessful, meaning that the staker was exposed, the aforementioned deposit will be slashed
//! for the amount of wasted work they have inflicted on the chain.
//!
//! All in all, this pallet is meant to provide an easy off-ramp for some stakers.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! 1. Fast-unstake with multiple participants in the queue.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", successful_multi_queue)]
//!
//! 2. Fast unstake failing because a nominator is exposed.
#![doc = docify::embed!("src/tests.rs", exposed_nominator_cannot_unstake)]
//!
//! ## Pallet API
//!
//! See the [`pallet`] module for more information about the interfaces this pallet exposes,
//! including its configuration trait, dispatchables, storage items, events and errors.
//!
//! ## Low Level / Implementation Details
//!
//! This pallet works off the basis of `on_idle`, meaning that it provides no guarantee about when
//! it will succeed, if at all. Moreover, the queue implementation is unordered. In case of
//! congestion, no FIFO ordering is provided.
//!
//! A few important considerations can be concluded based on the `on_idle`-based implementation:
//!
//! * It is crucial for the weights of this pallet to be correct. The code inside
//! [`Pallet::on_idle`] MUST be able to measure itself and report the remaining weight correctly
//! after execution.
//!
//! * If the weight measurement is incorrect, it can lead to perpetual overweight (consequently
//!   slow) blocks.
//!
//! * The amount of weight that `on_idle` consumes is a direct function of [`ErasToCheckPerBlock`].
//!
//! * Thus, a correct value of [`ErasToCheckPerBlock`] (which can be set via [`Pallet::control`])
//!   should be chosen, such that a reasonable amount of weight is used `on_idle`. If
//!   [`ErasToCheckPerBlock`] is too large, `on_idle` will always conclude that it has not enough
//!   weight to proceed, and will early-return. Nonetheless, this should also be *safe* as long as
//!   the benchmarking/weights are *accurate*.
//!
//! * See the inline code-comments on `do_on_idle` (private) for more details.
//!
//! * For further safety, in case of any unforeseen errors, the pallet will emit
//!   [`Event::InternalError`] and set [`ErasToCheckPerBlock`] back to 0, which essentially means
//!   the pallet will halt/disable itself.
