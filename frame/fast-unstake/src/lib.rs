//! A pallet that's designed to JUST do the following:
//!
//! If a nominator is not exposed in any `ErasStakers` (i.e. "has not actively backed any
//! validators in the last `BondingDuration` days"), then they can register themselves in this
//! pallet, unstake faster than having to wait an entire bonding duration.
//!
//! Appearing in the exposure of a validator means being exposed equal to that validator from the
//! point of view of the staking system. This usually means earning rewards with the validator, and
//! also being at the risk of slashing with the validator. This is equivalent to the "Active
//! Nominator" role explained in the
//! [February Staking Update](https://polkadot.network/blog/staking-update-february-2022/).
//!
//! This pallet works off the basis of `on_idle`, meaning that it provides no guarantee about when
//! it will succeed, if at all. Moreover, the queue implementation is unordered. In case of
//! congestion, no FIFO ordering is provided.
//!
//! Stakers who are certain about NOT being exposed can register themselves with
//! [`Call::register_fast_unstake`]. This will chill, and fully unbond the staker, and place them in
//! the queue to be checked.
//!
//! Once queued, but not being actively processed, stakers can withdraw their request via
//! [`Call::deregister`].
//!
//! Once queued, a staker wishing to unbond can perform no further action in pallet-staking. This is
//! to prevent them from accidentally exposing themselves behind a validator etc.
//!
//! Once processed, if successful, no additional fee for the checking process is taken, and the
//! staker is instantly unbonded.
//!
//! If unsuccessful, meaning that the staker was exposed sometime in the last `BondingDuration` eras
//! they will end up being slashed for the amount of wasted work they have inflicted on the chian.
