//! Additional logic for the Core Fellowship. This determines salary, registers activity/passivity
//! and handles promotion and demotion periods.
//!
//! This only handles members of non-zero rank.
//!
//! # Process Flow
//! - Begin with a call to `induct`, where some privileged origin (perhaps a pre-existing member of
//!   `rank > 1`) is able to make a candidate from an account and introduce it to be tracked in this
//!   pallet in order to allow evidence to be submitted and promotion voted on.
//! - The candidate then calls `submit_evidence` to apply for their promotion to rank 1.
//! - A `PromoteOrigin` of at least rank 1 calls `promote` on the candidate to elevate it to rank 1.
//! - Some time later but before rank 1's `demotion_period` elapses, candidate calls
//!   `submit_evidence` with evidence of their efforts to apply for approval to stay at rank 1.
//! - An `ApproveOrigin` of at least rank 1 calls `approve` on the candidate to avoid imminent
//!   demotion and keep it at rank 1.
//! - These last two steps continue until the candidate is ready to apply for a promotion, at which
//!   point the previous two steps are repeated with a higher rank.
//! - If the member fails to get an approval within the `demotion_period` then anyone may call
//!   `bump` to demote the candidate by one rank.
//! - If a candidate fails to be promoted to a member within the `offboard_timeout` period, then
//!   anyone may call `bump` to remove the account's candidacy.
//! - Pre-existing members may call `import` to have their rank recognised and be inducted into this
//!   pallet (to gain a salary and allow for eventual promotion).
//! - If, externally to this pallet, a member or candidate has their rank removed completely, then
//!   `offboard` may be called to remove them entirely from this pallet.
//!
//! Note there is a difference between having a rank of 0 (whereby the account is a *candidate*) and
//! having no rank at all (whereby we consider it *unranked*). An account can be demoted from rank
//! 0 to become unranked. This process is called being offboarded and there is an extrinsic to do
//! this explicitly when external factors to this pallet have caused the tracked account to become
//! unranked. At rank 0, there is not a "demotion" period after which the account may be bumped to
//! become offboarded but rather an "offboard timeout".
//!
//! Candidates may be introduced (i.e. an account to go from unranked to rank of 0) by an origin
//! of a different privilege to that for promotion. This allows the possibility for even a single
//! existing member to introduce a new candidate without payment.
//!
//! Only tracked/ranked accounts may submit evidence for their proof and promotion. Candidates
//! cannot be approved - they must proceed only to promotion prior to the offboard timeout elapsing.
