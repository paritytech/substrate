//! # Staking Pallet
//!
//! The Staking pallet is used to manage funds at stake by network maintainers.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//! - [`Pallet`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Staking pallet is the means by which a set of network maintainers (known as _authorities_ in
//! some contexts and _validators_ in others) are chosen based upon those who voluntarily place
//! funds under deposit. Under deposit, those funds are rewarded under normal operation but are held
//! at pain of _slash_ (expropriation) should the staked maintainer be found not to be discharging
//! its duties properly.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! - Staking: The process of locking up funds for some time, placing them at risk of slashing
//!   (loss) in order to become a rewarded maintainer of the network.
//! - Validating: The process of running a node to actively maintain the network, either by
//!   producing blocks or guaranteeing finality of the chain.
//! - Nominating: The process of placing staked funds behind one or more validators in order to
//!   share in any reward, and punishment, they take.
//! - Stash account: The account holding an owner's funds used for staking.
//! - Controller account: The account that controls an owner's funds for staking.
//! - Era: A (whole) number of sessions, which is the period that the validator set (and each
//!   validator's active nominator set) is recalculated and where rewards are paid out.
//! - Slash: The punishment of a staker by reducing its funds.
//!
//! ### Goals
//! <!-- Original author of paragraph: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! The staking system in Substrate NPoS is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! - Stake funds that are controlled by a cold wallet.
//! - Withdraw some, or deposit more, funds without interrupting the role of an entity.
//! - Switch between roles (nominator, validator, idle) with minimal overhead.
//!
//! ### Scenarios
//!
//! #### Staking
//!
//! Almost any interaction with the Staking pallet requires a process of _**bonding**_ (also known
//! as being a _staker_). To become *bonded*, a fund-holding account known as the _stash account_,
//! which holds some or all of the funds that become frozen in place as part of the staking process,
//! is paired with an active **controller** account, which issues instructions on how they shall be
//! used.
//!
//! An account pair can become bonded using the [`bond`](Call::bond) call.
//!
//! Stash accounts can change their associated controller using the
//! [`set_controller`](Call::set_controller) call.
//!
//! There are three possible roles that any staked account pair can be in: `Validator`, `Nominator`
//! and `Idle` (defined in [`StakerStatus`]). There are three
//! corresponding instructions to change between roles, namely:
//! [`validate`](Call::validate),
//! [`nominate`](Call::nominate), and [`chill`](Call::chill).
//!
//! #### Validating
//!
//! A **validator** takes the role of either validating blocks or ensuring their finality,
//! maintaining the veracity of the network. A validator should avoid both any sort of malicious
//! misbehavior and going offline. Bonded accounts that state interest in being a validator do NOT
//! get immediately chosen as a validator. Instead, they are declared as a _candidate_ and they
//! _might_ get elected at the _next era_ as a validator. The result of the election is determined
//! by nominators and their votes.
//!
//! An account can become a validator candidate via the
//! [`validate`](Call::validate) call.
//!
//! #### Nomination
//!
//! A **nominator** does not take any _direct_ role in maintaining the network, instead, it votes on
//! a set of validators  to be elected. Once interest in nomination is stated by an account, it
//! takes effect at the next election round. The funds in the nominator's stash account indicate the
//! _weight_ of its vote. Both the rewards and any punishment that a validator earns are shared
//! between the validator and its nominators. This rule incentivizes the nominators to NOT vote for
//! the misbehaving/offline validators as much as possible, simply because the nominators will also
//! lose funds if they vote poorly.
//!
//! An account can become a nominator via the [`nominate`](Call::nominate) call.
//!
//! #### Rewards and Slash
//!
//! The **reward and slashing** procedure is the core of the Staking pallet, attempting to _embrace
//! valid behavior_ while _punishing any misbehavior or lack of availability_.
//!
//! Rewards must be claimed for each era before it gets too old by `$HISTORY_DEPTH` using the
//! `payout_stakers` call. Any account can call `payout_stakers`, which pays the reward to the
//! validator as well as its nominators. Only the [`Config::MaxNominatorRewardedPerValidator`]
//! biggest stakers can claim their reward. This is to limit the i/o cost to mutate storage for each
//! nominator's account.
//!
//! Slashing can occur at any point in time, once misbehavior is reported. Once slashing is
//! determined, a value is deducted from the balance of the validator and all the nominators who
//! voted for this validator (values are deducted from the _stash_ account of the slashed entity).
//!
//! Slashing logic is further described in the documentation of the `slashing` pallet.
//!
//! Similar to slashing, rewards are also shared among a validator and its associated nominators.
//! Yet, the reward funds are not always transferred to the stash account and can be configured. See
//! [Reward Calculation](#reward-calculation) for more details.
//!
//! #### Chilling
//!
//! Finally, any of the roles above can choose to step back temporarily and just chill for a while.
//! This means that if they are a nominator, they will not be considered as voters anymore and if
//! they are validators, they will no longer be a candidate for the next election.
//!
//! An account can step back via the [`chill`](Call::chill) call.
//!
//! ### Session managing
//!
//! The pallet implement the trait `SessionManager`. Which is the only API to query new validator
//! set and allowing these validator set to be rewarded once their era is ended.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! The dispatchable functions of the Staking pallet enable the steps needed for entities to accept
//! and change their role, alongside some helper functions to get/set the metadata of the pallet.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! The Staking pallet contains many public storage items and (im)mutable functions.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Example: Rewarding a validator by id.
//!
//! ```
//! use frame_support::{decl_module, dispatch};
//! use frame_system::ensure_signed;
//! use pallet_staking::{self as staking};
//!
//! pub trait Config: staking::Config {}
//!
//! decl_module! {
//!     pub struct Module<T: Config> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
//!         /// Reward a validator.
//!         #[weight = 0]
//!         pub fn reward_myself(origin) -> dispatch::DispatchResult {
//!             let reported = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//!             <staking::Pallet<T>>::reward_by_ids(vec![(reported, 10)]);
//!             Ok(())
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementation Details
//!
//! ### Era payout
//!
//! The era payout is computed using yearly inflation curve defined at
//! [`Config::EraPayout`] as such:
//!
//! ```nocompile
//! staker_payout = yearly_inflation(npos_token_staked / total_tokens) * total_tokens / era_per_year
//! ```
//! This payout is used to reward stakers as defined in next section
//!
//! ```nocompile
//! remaining_payout = max_yearly_inflation * total_tokens / era_per_year - staker_payout
//! ```
//! The remaining reward is send to the configurable end-point
//! [`Config::RewardRemainder`].
//!
//! ### Reward Calculation
//!
//! Validators and nominators are rewarded at the end of each era. The total reward of an era is
//! calculated using the era duration and the staking rate (the total amount of tokens staked by
//! nominators and validators, divided by the total token supply). It aims to incentivize toward a
//! defined staking rate. The full specification can be found
//! [here](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/Token%20Economics.html#inflation-model).
//!
//! Total reward is split among validators and their nominators depending on the number of points
//! they received during the era. Points are added to a validator using
//! [`reward_by_ids`](Pallet::reward_by_ids).
//!
//! [`Pallet`] implements
//! [`pallet_authorship::EventHandler`] to add reward
//! points to block producer and block producer of referenced uncles.
//!
//! The validator and its nominator split their reward as following:
//!
//! The validator can declare an amount, named
//! [`commission`](ValidatorPrefs::commission), that does not get shared
//! with the nominators at each reward payout through its
//! [`ValidatorPrefs`]. This value gets deducted from the total reward
//! that is paid to the validator and its nominators. The remaining portion is split among the
//! validator and all of the nominators that nominated the validator, proportional to the value
//! staked behind this validator (_i.e._ dividing the
//! [`own`](Exposure::own) or
//! [`others`](Exposure::others) by
//! [`total`](Exposure::total) in [`Exposure`]).
//!
//! All entities who receive a reward have the option to choose their reward destination through the
//! [`Payee`] storage item (see
//! [`set_payee`](Call::set_payee)), to be one of the following:
//!
//! - Controller account, (obviously) not increasing the staked value.
//! - Stash account, not increasing the staked value.
//! - Stash account, also increasing the staked value.
//!
//! ### Additional Fund Management Operations
//!
//! Any funds already placed into stash can be the target of the following operations:
//!
//! The controller account can free a portion (or all) of the funds using the
//! [`unbond`](Call::unbond) call. Note that the funds are not immediately
//! accessible. Instead, a duration denoted by
//! [`Config::BondingDuration`] (in number of eras) must
//! pass until the funds can actually be removed. Once the `BondingDuration` is over, the
//! [`withdraw_unbonded`](Call::withdraw_unbonded) call can be used to actually
//! withdraw the funds.
//!
//! Note that there is a limitation to the number of fund-chunks that can be scheduled to be
//! unlocked in the future via [`unbond`](Call::unbond). In case this maximum
//! (`MAX_UNLOCKING_CHUNKS`) is reached, the bonded account _must_ first wait until a successful
//! call to `withdraw_unbonded` to remove some of the chunks.
//!
//! ### Election Algorithm
//!
//! The current election algorithm is implemented based on Phragmén. The reference implementation
//! can be found [here](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/tree/master/NPoS).
//!
//! The election algorithm, aside from electing the validators with the most stake value and votes,
//! tries to divide the nominator votes among candidates in an equal manner. To further assure this,
//! an optional post-processing can be applied that iteratively normalizes the nominator staked
//! values until the total difference among votes of a particular nominator are less than a
//! threshold.
//!
//! ## GenesisConfig
//!
//! The Staking pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`]. The
//! `GenesisConfig` is optional and allow to set some initial stakers.
//!
//! ## Related Modules
//!
//! - [Balances](../pallet_balances/index.html): Used to manage values at stake.
//! - [Session](../pallet_session/index.html): Used to manage sessions. Also, a list of new
//!   validators is stored in the Session pallet's `Validators` at the end of each era.
