//! Collective system: Members of a set of account IDs can make their collective feelings known
//! through dispatched calls from one of two specialized origins.
//!
//! The membership can be provided in one of two ways: either directly, using the Root-dispatchable
//! function `set_members`, or indirectly, through implementing the `ChangeMembers`.
//! The pallet assumes that the amount of members stays at or below `MaxMembers` for its weight
//! calculations, but enforces this neither in `set_members` nor in `change_members_sorted`.
//!
//! A "prime" member may be set to help determine the default vote behavior based on chain
//! config. If `PreimDefaultVote` is used, the prime vote acts as the default vote in case of any
//! abstentions after the voting period. If `MoreThanMajorityThenPrimeDefaultVote` is used, then
//! abstentations will first follow the majority of the collective voting, and then the prime
//! member.
//!
//! Voting happens through motions comprising a proposal (i.e. a curried dispatchable) plus a
//! number of approvals required for it to pass and be called. Motions are open for members to
//! vote on for a minimum period given by `MotionDuration`. As soon as the needed number of
//! approvals is given, the motion is closed and executed. If the number of approvals is not reached
//! during the voting period, then `close` may be called by any account in order to force the end
//! the motion explicitly. If a prime member is defined then their vote is used in place of any
//! abstentions and the proposal is executed if there are enough approvals counting the new votes.
//!
//! If there are not, or if no prime is set, then the motion is dropped without being executed.
