//! Primitive traits for providing election functionality.
//!
//! This crate provides two traits that could interact to enable extensible election functionality
//! within FRAME pallets.
//!
//! Something that will provide the functionality of election will implement [`ElectionProvider`],
//! whilst needing an associated [`ElectionProvider::DataProvider`], which needs to be fulfilled by
//! an entity implementing [`ElectionDataProvider`]. Most often, *the data provider is* the receiver
//! of the election, resulting in a diagram as below:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!                                         ElectionDataProvider
//!                          <------------------------------------------+
//!                          |                                          |
//!                          v                                          |
//!                    +-----+----+                              +------+---+
//!                    |          |                              |          |
//! pallet-do-election |          |                              |          | pallet-needs-election
//!                    |          |                              |          |
//!                    |          |                              |          |
//!                    +-----+----+                              +------+---+
//!                          |                                          ^
//!                          |                                          |
//!                          +------------------------------------------+
//!                                         ElectionProvider
//! ```
//!
//! > It could also be possible that a third party pallet (C), provides the data of election to an
//! > election provider (B), which then passes the election result to another pallet (A).
//!
//! ## Election Types
//!
//! Typically, two types of elections exist:
//!
//! 1. **Stateless**: Election data is provided, and the election result is immediately ready.
//! 2. **Stateful**: Election data is is queried ahead of time, and the election result might be
//!    ready some number of blocks in the future.
//!
//! To accommodate both type of elections in one trait, the traits lean toward **stateful
//! election**, as it is more general than the stateless. This is why [`ElectionProvider::elect`]
//! has no parameters. All value and type parameter must be provided by the [`ElectionDataProvider`]
//! trait, even if the election happens immediately.
//!
//! ## Election Data
//!
//! The data associated with an election, essentially what the [`ElectionDataProvider`] must convey
//! is as follows:
//!
//! 1. A list of voters, with their stake.
//! 2. A list of targets (i.e. _candidates_).
//! 3. A number of desired targets to be elected (i.e. _winners_)
//!
//! In addition to that, the [`ElectionDataProvider`] must also hint [`ElectionProvider`] at when
//! the next election might happen ([`ElectionDataProvider::next_election_prediction`]). A stateless
//! election provider would probably ignore this. A stateful election provider can use this to
//! prepare the election result in advance.
//!
//! Nonetheless, an [`ElectionProvider`] shan't rely on this and should preferably provide some
//! means of fallback election as well, in case the `elect` was called immaturely early.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use frame_election_provider_support::{*, data_provider};
//! # use sp_npos_elections::{Support, Assignment};
//!
//! type AccountId = u64;
//! type Balance = u64;
//! type BlockNumber = u32;
//!
//! mod data_provider_mod {
//!     use super::*;
//!
//!     pub trait Config: Sized {
//!         type ElectionProvider: ElectionProvider<
//!             AccountId,

//!             DataProvider = Module<Self>,
//!         >;

//!

//!         const MAXIMUM_VOTES_PER_VOTER: u32 = 1;
//!         fn desired_targets() -> data_provider::Result<u32> {
//!             Ok(1)

//!             0
//!         }
//!     }
