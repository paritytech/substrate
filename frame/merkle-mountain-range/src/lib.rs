//! # Merkle Mountain Range
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Details on Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMRs) can be found here:
//! <https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/master/doc/mmr.md>
//!
//! The MMR pallet constructs a MMR from leaf data obtained on every block from
//! `LeafDataProvider`. MMR nodes are stored both in:
//! - on-chain storage - hashes only; not full leaf content)
//! - off-chain storage - via Indexing API we push full leaf content (and all internal nodes as
//! well) to the Off-chain DB, so that the data is available for Off-chain workers.
//! Hashing used for MMR is configurable independently from the rest of the runtime (i.e. not using
//! `frame_system::Hashing`) so something compatible with external chains can be used (like
//! Keccak256 for Ethereum compatibility).
//!
//! Depending on the usage context (off-chain vs on-chain) the pallet is able to:
//! - verify MMR leaf proofs (on-chain)
//! - generate leaf proofs (off-chain)
//!
//! See [primitives::Compact] documentation for how you can optimize proof size for leafs that are
//! composed from multiple elements.
//!
//! ## What for?
//!
//! Primary use case for this pallet is to generate MMR root hashes, that can latter on be used by
//! BEEFY protocol (see <https://github.com/paritytech/grandpa-bridge-gadget>).
//! MMR root hashes along with BEEFY will make it possible to build Super Light Clients (SLC) of
//! Substrate-based chains. The SLC will be able to follow finality and can be shown proofs of more
//! details that happened on the source chain.
//! In that case the chain which contains the pallet generates the Root Hashes and Proofs, which
//! are then presented to another chain acting as a light client which can verify them.
//!
//! Secondary use case is to archive historical data, but still be able to retrieve them on-demand
//! if needed. For instance if parent block hashes are stored in the MMR it's possible at any point
//! in time to provide a MMR proof about some past block hash, while this data can be safely pruned
//! from on-chain storage.
//!
//! NOTE This pallet is experimental and not proven to work in production.
