//! # Assets Pallet
//!
//! A simple, secure module for dealing with fungible assets.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Assets module provides functionality for asset management of fungible asset classes
//! with a fixed supply, including:
//!
//! * Asset Issuance (Minting)
//! * Asset Transferal
//! * Asset Freezing
//! * Asset Destruction (Burning)
//! * Delegated Asset Transfers ("Approval API")
//!
//! To use it in your runtime, you need to implement the assets [`Config`].
//!
//! The supported dispatchable functions are documented in the [`Call`] enum.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! * **Admin**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to unfreeze (thaw) an account and it's
//!   assets, as well as forcibly transfer a particular class of assets between arbitrary accounts
//!   and reduce the balance of a particular class of assets of arbitrary accounts.
//! * **Asset issuance/minting**: The creation of a new asset, whose total supply will belong to the
//!   account that issues the asset. This is a privileged operation.
//! * **Asset transfer**: The reduction of the balance of an asset of one account with the
//!   corresponding increase in the balance of another.
//! * **Asset destruction**: The process of reduce the balance of an asset of one account. This is a
//!   privileged operation.
//! * **Fungible asset**: An asset whose units are interchangeable.
//! * **Issuer**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to mint a particular class of assets.
//! * **Freezer**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to freeze an account from
//!   transferring a particular class of assets.
//! * **Freezing**: Removing the possibility of an unpermissioned transfer of an asset from a
//!   particular account.
//! * **Non-fungible asset**: An asset for which each unit has unique characteristics.
//! * **Owner**: An account ID uniquely privileged to be able to destroy a particular asset class,
//!   or to set the Issuer, Freezer or Admin of that asset class.
//! * **Approval**: The act of allowing an account the permission to transfer some balance of asset
//!   from the approving account into some third-party destination account.
//! * **Sufficiency**: The idea of a minimum-balance of an asset being sufficient to allow the
//!   account's existence on the system without requiring any other existential-deposit.
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! The assets system in Substrate is designed to make the following possible:
//!
//! * Issue a new assets in a permissioned or permissionless way, if permissionless, then with a
//!   deposit required.
//! * Allow accounts to be delegated the ability to transfer assets without otherwise existing
//!   on-chain (*approvals*).
//! * Move assets between accounts.
//! * Update the asset's total supply.
//! * Allow administrative activities by specially privileged accounts including freezing account
//!   balances and minting/burning assets.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Permissionless Functions
//!
//! * `create`: Creates a new asset class, taking the required deposit.
//! * `transfer`: Transfer sender's assets to another account.
//! * `transfer_keep_alive`: Transfer sender's assets to another account, keeping the sender alive.
//! * `set_metadata`: Set the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `clear_metadata`: Remove the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `approve_transfer`: Create or increase an delegated transfer.
//! * `cancel_approval`: Rescind a previous approval.
//! * `transfer_approved`: Transfer third-party's assets to another account.
//!
//! ### Permissioned Functions
//!
//! * `force_create`: Creates a new asset class without taking any deposit.
//! * `force_set_metadata`: Set the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `force_clear_metadata`: Remove the metadata of an asset class.
//! * `force_asset_status`: Alter an asset class's attributes.
//! * `force_cancel_approval`: Rescind a previous approval.
//!
//! ### Privileged Functions
//! * `destroy`: Destroys an entire asset class; called by the asset class's Owner.
//! * `mint`: Increases the asset balance of an account; called by the asset class's Issuer.
//! * `burn`: Decreases the asset balance of an account; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `force_transfer`: Transfers between arbitrary accounts; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `freeze`: Disallows further `transfer`s from an account; called by the asset class's Freezer.
//! * `thaw`: Allows further `transfer`s from an account; called by the asset class's Admin.
//! * `transfer_ownership`: Changes an asset class's Owner; called by the asset class's Owner.
//! * `set_team`: Changes an asset class's Admin, Freezer and Issuer; called by the asset class's
//!   Owner.
//!
//! Please refer to the [`Call`] enum and its associated variants for documentation on each
//! function.
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//! <!-- Original author of descriptions: @gavofyork -->
//!
//! * `balance` - Get the asset `id` balance of `who`.
//! * `total_supply` - Get the total supply of an asset `id`.
//!
//! Please refer to the [`Pallet`] struct for details on publicly available functions.
//!
