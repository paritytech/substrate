//! A lottery pallet that uses participation in the network to purchase tickets.
//!
//! With this pallet, you can configure a lottery, which is a pot of money that
//! users contribute to, and that is reallocated to a single user at the end of
//! the lottery period. Just like a normal lottery system, to participate, you
//! need to "buy a ticket", which is used to fund the pot.
//!
//! The unique feature of this lottery system is that tickets can only be
//! purchased by making a "valid call" dispatched through this pallet.
//! By configuring certain calls to be valid for the lottery, you can encourage
//! users to make those calls on your network. An example of how this could be
//! used is to set validator nominations as a valid lottery call. If the lottery
//! is set to repeat every month, then users would be encouraged to re-nominate
//! validators every month. A user can ony purchase one ticket per valid call
//! per lottery.
//!
//! This pallet can be configured to use dynamically set calls or statically set
//! calls. Call validation happens through the `ValidateCall` implementation.
//! This pallet provides one implementation of this using the `CallIndices`
//! storage item. You can also make your own implementation at the runtime level
//! which can contain much more complex logic, such as validation of the
//! parameters, which this pallet alone cannot do.
//!
//! This pallet uses the modulus operator to pick a random winner. It is known
//! that this might introduce a bias if the random number chosen in a range that
//! is not perfectly divisible by the total number of participants. The
//! `MaxGenerateRandom` configuration can help mitigate this by generating new
//! numbers until we hit the limit or we find a "fair" number. This is best
//! effort only.
