//! # Tipping Pallet ( pallet-tips )
//!
//! > NOTE: This pallet is tightly coupled with pallet-treasury.
//!
//! A subsystem to allow for an agile "tipping" process, whereby a reward may be given without first
//! having a pre-determined stakeholder group come to consensus on how much should be paid.
//!
//! A group of `Tippers` is determined through the config `Config`. After half of these have
//! declared some amount that they believe a particular reported reason deserves, then a countdown
//! period is entered where any remaining members can declare their tip amounts also. After the
//! close of the countdown period, the median of all declared tips is paid to the reported
//! beneficiary, along with any finders fee, in case of a public (and bonded) original report.
//!
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! Tipping protocol:
//! - **Tipping:** The process of gathering declarations of amounts to tip and taking the median
//!   amount to be transferred from the treasury to a beneficiary account.
//! - **Tip Reason:** The reason for a tip; generally a URL which embodies or explains why a
//!   particular individual (identified by an account ID) is worthy of a recognition by the
//!   treasury.
//! - **Finder:** The original public reporter of some reason for tipping.
//! - **Finders Fee:** Some proportion of the tip amount that is paid to the reporter of the tip,
//!   rather than the main beneficiary.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! Tipping protocol:
//! - `report_awesome` - Report something worthy of a tip and register for a finders fee.
//! - `retract_tip` - Retract a previous (finders fee registered) report.
//! - `tip_new` - Report an item worthy of a tip and declare a specific amount to tip.
//! - `tip` - Declare or redeclare an amount to tip for a particular reason.
//! - `close_tip` - Close and pay out a tip.
