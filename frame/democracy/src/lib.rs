//! # Democracy Pallet
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Democracy pallet handles the administration of general stakeholder voting.
//!
//! There are two different queues that a proposal can be added to before it
//! becomes a referendum, 1) the proposal queue consisting of all public proposals
//! and 2) the external queue consisting of a single proposal that originates
//! from one of the _external_ origins (such as a collective group).
//!
//! Every launch period - a length defined in the runtime - the Democracy pallet
//! launches a referendum from a proposal that it takes from either the proposal
//! queue or the external queue in turn. Any token holder in the system can vote
//! on referenda. The voting system
//! uses time-lock voting by allowing the token holder to set their _conviction_
//! behind a vote. The conviction will dictate the length of time the tokens
//! will be locked, as well as the multiplier that scales the vote power.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Enactment Period:** The minimum period of locking and the period between a proposal being
//! approved and enacted.
//! - **Lock Period:** A period of time after proposal enactment that the tokens of _winning_ voters
//! will be locked.
//! - **Conviction:** An indication of a voter's strength of belief in their vote. An increase
//! of one in conviction indicates that a token holder is willing to lock their tokens for twice
//! as many lock periods after enactment.
//! - **Vote:** A value that can either be in approval ("Aye") or rejection ("Nay") of a particular
//!   referendum.
//! - **Proposal:** A submission to the chain that represents an action that a proposer (either an
//! account or an external origin) suggests that the system adopt.
//! - **Referendum:** A proposal that is in the process of being voted on for either acceptance or
//!   rejection as a change to the system.
//! - **Delegation:** The act of granting your voting power to the decisions of another account for
//!   up to a certain conviction.
//!
//! ### Adaptive Quorum Biasing
//!
//! A _referendum_ can be either simple majority-carries in which 50%+1 of the
//! votes decide the outcome or _adaptive quorum biased_. Adaptive quorum biasing
//! makes the threshold for passing or rejecting a referendum higher or lower
//! depending on how the referendum was originally proposed. There are two types of
//! adaptive quorum biasing: 1) _positive turnout bias_ makes a referendum
//! require a super-majority to pass that decreases as turnout increases and
//! 2) _negative turnout bias_ makes a referendum require a super-majority to
//! reject that decreases as turnout increases. Another way to think about the
//! quorum biasing is that _positive bias_ referendums will be rejected by
//! default and _negative bias_ referendums get passed by default.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### Public
//!
//! These calls can be made from any externally held account capable of creating
//! a signed extrinsic.
//!
//! Basic actions:
//! - `propose` - Submits a sensitive action, represented as a hash. Requires a deposit.
//! - `second` - Signals agreement with a proposal, moves it higher on the proposal queue, and
//!   requires a matching deposit to the original.
//! - `vote` - Votes in a referendum, either the vote is "Aye" to enact the proposal or "Nay" to
//!   keep the status quo.
//! - `unvote` - Cancel a previous vote, this must be done by the voter before the vote ends.
//! - `delegate` - Delegates the voting power (tokens * conviction) to another account.
//! - `undelegate` - Stops the delegation of voting power to another account.
//!
//! Administration actions that can be done to any account:
//! - `reap_vote` - Remove some account's expired votes.
//! - `unlock` - Redetermine the account's balance lock, potentially making tokens available.
//!
//! Preimage actions:
//! - `note_preimage` - Registers the preimage for an upcoming proposal, requires a deposit that is
//!   returned once the proposal is enacted.
//! - `note_preimage_operational` - same but provided by `T::OperationalPreimageOrigin`.
//! - `note_imminent_preimage` - Registers the preimage for an upcoming proposal. Does not require a
//!   deposit, but the proposal must be in the dispatch queue.
//! - `note_imminent_preimage_operational` - same but provided by `T::OperationalPreimageOrigin`.
//! - `reap_preimage` - Removes the preimage for an expired proposal. Will only work under the
//!   condition that it's the same account that noted it and after the voting period, OR it's a
//!   different account after the enactment period.
//!
//! #### Cancellation Origin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `CancellationOrigin`.
//!
//! - `emergency_cancel` - Schedules an emergency cancellation of a referendum. Can only happen once
//!   to a specific referendum.
//!
//! #### ExternalOrigin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `ExternalOrigin`.
//!
//! - `external_propose` - Schedules a proposal to become a referendum once it is is legal for an
//!   externally proposed referendum.
//!
//! #### External Majority Origin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `ExternalMajorityOrigin`.
//!
//! - `external_propose_majority` - Schedules a proposal to become a majority-carries referendum
//!   once it is legal for an externally proposed referendum.
//!
//! #### External Default Origin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `ExternalDefaultOrigin`.
//!
//! - `external_propose_default` - Schedules a proposal to become a negative-turnout-bias referendum
//!   once it is legal for an externally proposed referendum.
//!
//! #### Fast Track Origin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `FastTrackOrigin`.
//!
//! - `fast_track` - Schedules the current externally proposed proposal that is "majority-carries"
//!   to become a referendum immediately.
//!
//! #### Veto Origin
//!
//! This call can only be made by the `VetoOrigin`.
//!
//! - `veto_external` - Vetoes and blacklists the external proposal hash.
//!
//! #### Root
//!
//! - `cancel_referendum` - Removes a referendum.
//! - `cancel_queued` - Cancels a proposal that is queued for enactment.
//! - `clear_public_proposal` - Removes all public proposals.
