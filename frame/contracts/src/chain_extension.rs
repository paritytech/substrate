//! A mechanism for runtime authors to augment the functionality of contracts.
//!
//! The runtime is able to call into any contract and retrieve the result using
//! [`bare_call`](crate::Pallet::bare_call). This already allows customization of runtime
//! behaviour by user generated code (contracts). However, often it is more straightforward
//! to allow the reverse behaviour: The contract calls into the runtime. We call the latter
//! one a "chain extension" because it allows the chain to extend the set of functions that are
//! callable by a contract.
//!
//! In order to create a chain extension the runtime author implements the [`ChainExtension`]
//! trait and declares it in this pallet's [configuration Trait](crate::Config). All types
//! required for this endeavour are defined or re-exported in this module. There is an
//! implementation on `()` which can be used to signal that no chain extension is available.
//!
//! # Using multiple chain extensions
//!
//! Often there is a need for having multiple chain extensions. This is often the case when
//! some generally useful off-the-shelf extensions should be included. To have multiple chain
//! extensions they can be put into a tuple which is then passed to [`Config::ChainExtension`] like
//! this `type Extensions = (ExtensionA, ExtensionB)`.
//!
//! However, only extensions implementing [`RegisteredChainExtension`] can be put into a tuple.
//! This is because the [`RegisteredChainExtension::ID`] is used to decide which of those extensions
//! should be used when the contract calls a chain extensions. Extensions which are generally
//! useful should claim their `ID` with [the registry](https://github.com/paritytech/chainextension-registry)
//! so that no collisions with other vendors will occur.
//!
//! **Chain specific extensions must use the reserved `ID = 0` so that they can't be registered with
//! the registry.**
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! The chain author alone is responsible for the security of the chain extension.
//! This includes avoiding the exposure of exploitable functions and charging the
//! appropriate amount of weight. In order to do so benchmarks must be written and the
//! [`charge_weight`](Environment::charge_weight) function must be called **before**
//! carrying out any action that causes the consumption of the chargeable weight.
//! It cannot be overstated how delicate of a process the creation of a chain extension
//! is. Check whether using [`bare_call`](crate::Pallet::bare_call) suffices for the
//! use case at hand.
//!
//! # Benchmarking
//!
//! The builtin contract callable functions that pallet-contracts provides all have
//! benchmarks that determine the correct weight that an invocation of these functions
//! induces. In order to be able to charge the correct weight for the functions defined
//! by a chain extension benchmarks must be written, too. In the near future this crate
//! will provide the means for easier creation of those specialized benchmarks.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! The ink-examples repository maintains an
//! [end-to-end example](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-examples/tree/main/rand-extension)
//! on how to use a chain extension in order to provide new features to ink! contracts.
