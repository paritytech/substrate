//! # Contract Pallet
//!
//! The Contract module provides functionality for the runtime to deploy and execute WebAssembly
//! smart-contracts.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This module extends accounts based on the [`Currency`] trait to have smart-contract
//! functionality. It can be used with other modules that implement accounts based on [`Currency`].
//! These "smart-contract accounts" have the ability to instantiate smart-contracts and make calls
//! to other contract and non-contract accounts.
//!
//! The smart-contract code is stored once in a code cache, and later retrievable via its hash.
//! This means that multiple smart-contracts can be instantiated from the same hash, without
//! replicating the code each time.
//!
//! When a smart-contract is called, its associated code is retrieved via the code hash and gets
//! executed. This call can alter the storage entries of the smart-contract account, instantiate new
//! smart-contracts, or call other smart-contracts.
//!
//! Finally, when an account is reaped, its associated code and storage of the smart-contract
//! account will also be deleted.
//!
//! ### Gas
//!
//! Senders must specify a gas limit with every call, as all instructions invoked by the
//! smart-contract require gas. Unused gas is refunded after the call, regardless of the execution
//! outcome.
//!
//! If the gas limit is reached, then all calls and state changes (including balance transfers) are
//! only reverted at the current call's contract level. For example, if contract A calls B and B
//! runs out of gas mid-call, then all of B's calls are reverted. Assuming correct error handling by
//! contract A, A's other calls and state changes still persist.
//!
//! ### Notable Scenarios
//!
//! Contract call failures are not always cascading. When failures occur in a sub-call, they do not
//! "bubble up", and the call will only revert at the specific contract level. For example, if
//! contract A calls contract B, and B fails, A can decide how to handle that failure, either
//! proceeding or reverting A's changes.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable functions
//!
//! * [`Pallet::instantiate_with_code`] - Deploys a new contract from the supplied wasm binary,
//! optionally transferring
//! some balance. This instantiates a new smart contract account with the supplied code and
//! calls its constructor to initialize the contract.
//! * [`Pallet::instantiate`] - The same as `instantiate_with_code` but instead of uploading new
//! code an existing `code_hash` is supplied.
//! * [`Pallet::call`] - Makes a call to an account, optionally transferring some balance.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The Contract module is a work in progress. The following examples show how this Contract module
//! can be used to instantiate and call contracts.
//!
//! * [`ink`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is
//! an [`eDSL`](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) that enables writing
//! WebAssembly based smart contracts in the Rust programming language. This is a work in progress.
