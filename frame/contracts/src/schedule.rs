///    meaningful benchmark result. However, in contrast to the instructions mentioned
///    in 2. they can be spammed. We price them with the same weight as the "default"
///    instruction (i64.const): Block, Loop, Nop
/// 4. We price both i64.const and drop as InstructionWeights.i64const / 2. The reason
///    for that is that we cannot benchmark either of them on its own but we need their
///    individual values to derive (by subtraction) the weight of all other instructions
///    that use them as supporting instructions. Supporting means mainly pushing arguments
///    and dropping return values in order to maintain a valid module.
