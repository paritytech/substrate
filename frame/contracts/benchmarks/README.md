# Benchmarks

This directory contains real world (ink!, solang) contracts which are used in macro benchmarks.
Those benchmarks are not used to determine weights but rather to compare different contract
languages and execution engines with larger wasm modules.

Files in this directory are used by `#[extra]` benchmarks in `src/benchmarking`. The json
files are for informational purposes only and are not consumed by the benchmarks.
