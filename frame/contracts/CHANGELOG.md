# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The semantic versioning guarantees cover the interface to the substrate runtime which
includes this pallet as a dependency. This module will also add storage migrations whenever
changes require it. Stability with regard to offchain tooling is explicitly excluded from
this guarantee: For example adding a new field to an in-storage data structure will require
changes to frontends to properly display it. However, those changes will still be regarded
as a minor version bump.

The interface provided to smart contracts will adhere to semver with one exception: Even
major version bumps will be backwards compatible with regard to already deployed contracts.
In other words: Upgrading this pallet will not break pre-existing contracts.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Allow contracts to dispatch calls into the runtime (**unstable**)
[#9276](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9276)

- New **unstable** version of `seal_call` that offers more features.
[#8909](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8909)

- New **unstable** `seal_rent_params` and `seal_rent_status` contract callable function.
[#8231](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8231)
[#8780](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8780)

- New `instantiate` RPC that allows clients to dry-run contract instantiation.
[#8451](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8451)

- New version of `seal_random` which exposes additional information.
[#8329](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8329)

### Changed

- Replaced `seal_println` with the `seal_debug_message` API which allows outputting debug
messages to the console and RPC clients.
[#8773](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8773)
[#9550](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9550)

- Make storage and fields of `Schedule` private to the crate.
[#8359](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8359)

### Fixed

- Remove pre-charging which caused wrongly estimated weights
[#8976](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8976)

## [v3.0.0] 2021-02-25

This version constitutes the first release that brings any stability guarantees (see above).

### Added

- Emit an event when a contract terminates (self-destructs).
[#8014](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8014)

- Charge rent for code stored on the chain in addition to the already existing
rent that is paid for data storage.
[#7935](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7935)

- Allow the runtime to configure per storage item costs in addition
to the already existing per byte costs.
[#7819](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7819)

- Contracts are now deleted lazily so that the user who removes a contract
does not need to pay for the deletion of the contract storage.
[#7740](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7740)

- Allow runtime authors to define chain extensions in order to provide custom
functionality to contracts.
[#7548](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7548)
[#8003](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8003)

- Proper weights which are fully automated by benchmarking.
[#6715](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/6715)
[#7017](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7017)
[#7361](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7361)

### Changed

- Collect the rent for one block during instantiation.
[#7847](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7847)

- Instantiation takes a `salt` argument to allow for easier instantion of the
same code by the same sender.
[#7482](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7482)

- Improve the information returned by the `contracts_call` RPC.
[#7468](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7468)

- Simplify the node configuration necessary to add this module.
[#7409](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7409)

### Fixed

- Consider the code size of a contract in the weight that is charged for
loading a contract from storage.
[#8086](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8086)

- Fix possible overflow in storage size calculation
[#7885](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7885)

- Cap the surcharge reward that can be claimed.
[#7870](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7870)

- Fix a possible DoS vector where contracts could allocate too large buffers.
[#7818](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7818)
