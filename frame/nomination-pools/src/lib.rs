//! # Nomination Pools for Staking Delegation
//!
//! A pallet that allows delegators to delegate their stake to nominating pools, each of which acts
//! as a nominator and nominates validators on the delegators behalf.
//!
//! # Index
//!
//! * [Key terms](#key-terms)
//! * [Usage](#usage)
//! * [Design](#design)
//!
//! ## Key terms
//!
//!  * bonded pool: Tracks the distribution of actively staked funds. See [`BondedPool`] and
//! [`BondedPoolInner`]. Bonded pools are identified via the pools bonded account.
//! * reward pool: Tracks rewards earned by actively staked funds. See [`RewardPool`] and
//!   [`RewardPools`]. Reward pools are identified via the pools bonded account.
//! * unbonding sub pools: Collection of pools at different phases of the unbonding lifecycle. See
//!   [`SubPools`] and [`SubPoolsStorage`]. Sub pools are identified via the pools bonded account.
//! * delegators: Accounts that are members of pools. See [`Delegator`] and [`Delegators`].
//!   Delegators are identified via their account.
//! * point: A measure of a delegators portion of a pools funds.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Join
//!
//! A account can stake funds with a nomination pool by calling [`Call::join`].
//!
//! For design docs see the [joining](#joining) section.
//!
//! ### Claim rewards
//!
//! After joining a pool, a delegator can claim rewards by calling [`Call::claim_payout`].
//!
//! For design docs see the [reward pool](#reward-pool) section.
//!
//! ### Leave
//!
//! In order to leave, a delegator must take two steps.
//!
//! First, they must call [`Call::unbond_other`]. The unbond other extrinsic will start the
//! unbonding process by unbonding all of the delegators funds.
//!
//! Second, once [`sp_staking::StakingInterface::bonding_duration`] eras have passed, the delegator
//! can call [`Call::withdraw_unbonded_other`] to withdraw all there funds.
//!
//! For design docs see the [bonded pool](#bonded-pool) and [unbonding sub
//! pools](#unbonding-sub-pools) sections.
//!
//! ### Slashes
//!
//! Slashes are distributed evenly across the bonded pool and the unbonding pools from slash era+1
//! through the slash apply era. Thus, any delegator who either a) unbonded or b) was actively
//! bonded in the aforementioned range of eras will be affected by the slash. A delegator is slashed
//! pro-rata based on its stake relative to the total slash amount.
//!
//! For design docs see the [slashing](#slashing) section.
//!
//! ### Adminstration
//!
//! A pool can be created with the [`Call::create`] call. Once created, the pools nominator or root
//! user must call [`Call::nominate`] to start nominating. [`Call::nominate`] can be called at
//! anytime to update validator selection.
//!
//! To help facilitate pool adminstration the pool has one of three states (see [`PoolState`]):
//!
//! * Open: Anyone can join the pool and no delegators can be permissionlessly removed.
//! * Blocked: No delegators can join and some admin roles can kick delegators.
//! * Destroying: No delegators can join and all delegators can be permissionlessly removed with
//!   [`Call::unbond_other`] and [`Call::withdraw_unbonded_other`]. Once a pool is destroying state,
//!   it cannot be reverted to another state.
//!
//! A pool has 3 administrative positions (see [`BondedPool`]):
//!
//! * Depositor: creates the pool and is the initial delegator. The can only leave pool once all
//!   other delegators have left. Once they fully leave the pool is destroyed.
//! * Nominator: can select which validators the pool nominates.
//! * State-Toggler: can change the pools state and kick delegators if the pool is blocked.
//! * Root: can change the nominator, state-toggler, or itself and can perform any of the actions
//!   the nominator or state-toggler can.
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! _Notes_: this section uses pseudo code to explain general design and does not necessarily
//! reflect the exact implementation. Additionally, a working knowledge of `pallet-staking`'s api is
//! assumed.
//!
//! ### Goals
//!
//! * Maintain network security by upholding integrity of slashing events, sufficiently penalizing
//!   delegators that where in the pool while it was backing a validator that got slashed.
//! * Maximize scalability in terms of delegator count.
//!
//! In order to maintain scalability, all operations are independent of the number of delegators. To
//! do this, delegation specific information is stored local to the delegator while the pool data
//! structures have bounded datum.
//!
//! ### Bonded pool
//!
//! A bonded pool nominates with its total balance, excluding that which has been withdrawn for
//! unbonding. The total points of a bonded pool are always equal to the sum of points of the
//! delegation members. A bonded pool tracks its points and reads its bonded balance.
//!
//! When a delegator joins a pool, `amount_transferred` is transferred from the delegators account
//! to the bonded pools account. Then the pool calls `staking::bond_extra(amount_transferred)` and
//! issues new points which are tracked by the delegator and added to the bonded pool's points.
//!
//! When the pool already has some balance, we want the value of a point before the transfer to
//! equal the value of a point after the transfer. So, when a delegator joins a bonded pool with a
//! given `amount_transferred`, we maintain the ratio of bonded balance to points such that:
//!
//! ```text
//! balance_after_transfer / points_after_transfer == balance_before_transfer / points_before_transfer;
//! ```
//!
//! To achieve this, we issue points based on the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! points_issued = (points_before_transfer / balance_before_transfer) * amount_transferred;
//! ```
//!
//! For new bonded pools we can set the points issued per balance arbitrarily. In this
//! implementation we use a 1 points to 1 balance ratio for pool creation (see
//! [`POINTS_TO_BALANCE_INIT_RATIO`]).
//!
//! **Relevant extrinsics:**
//!
//! * [`Call::create`]
//! * [`Call::join`]
//!
//! ### Reward pool
//!
//! When a pool is first bonded it sets up an arbitrary account as its reward destination. To track
//! staking rewards we track how the balance of this reward account changes.
//!
//! The reward pool needs to store:
//!
//! * The pool balance at the time of the last payout: `reward_pool.balance`
//! * The total earnings ever at the time of the last payout: `reward_pool.total_earnings`
//! * The total points in the pool at the time of the last payout: `reward_pool.points`
//!
//! And the delegator needs to store:
//!
//! * The total payouts at the time of the last payout by that delegator:
//!   `delegator.reward_pool_total_earnings`
//!
//! Before the first reward claim is initiated for a pool, all the above variables are set to zero.
//!
//! When a delegator initiates a claim, the following happens:
//!
//! 1) Compute the reward pool's total points and the delegator's virtual points in the reward pool
//!     * First `current_total_earnings` is computed (`current_balance` is the free balance of the
//!       reward pool at the beginning of these operations.)
//!			```text
//!			current_total_earnings =
//!       		current_balance - reward_pool.balance + pool.total_earnings;
//!			```
//!     * Then the `current_points` is computed. Every balance unit that was added to the reward
//!       pool since last time recorded means that the `pool.points` is increased by
//!       `bonding_pool.total_points`. In other words, for every unit of balance that has been
//!       earned by the reward pool, the reward pool points are inflated by `bonded_pool.points`. In
//!       effect this allows each, single unit of balance (e.g. planck) to be divvied up pro-rata
//!       among delegators based on points.
//!			```text
//!			new_earnings = current_total_earnings - reward_pool.total_earnings;
//!       	current_points = reward_pool.points + bonding_pool.points * new_earnings;
//!			```
//!     * Finally, the`delegator_virtual_points` are computed: the product of the delegator's points
//!       in the bonding pool and the total inflow of balance units since the last time the
//!       delegator claimed rewards
//!			```text
//!			new_earnings_since_last_claim = current_total_earnings - delegator.reward_pool_total_earnings;
//!        	delegator_virtual_points = delegator.points * new_earnings_since_last_claim;
//!       	```
//! 2) Compute the `delegator_payout`:
//!     ```text
//!     delegator_pool_point_ratio = delegator_virtual_points / current_points;
//!     delegator_payout = current_balance * delegator_pool_point_ratio;
//!     ```
//! 3) Transfer `delegator_payout` to the delegator
//! 4) For the delegator set:
//!     ```text
//!     delegator.reward_pool_total_earnings = current_total_earnings;
//!     ```
//! 5) For the pool set:
//!     ```text
//!     reward_pool.points = current_points - delegator_virtual_points;
//!     reward_pool.balance = current_balance - delegator_payout;
//!     reward_pool.total_earnings = current_total_earnings;
//!     ```
//!
//! _Note_: One short coming of this design is that new joiners can claim rewards for the era after
//! they join even though their funds did not contribute to the pools vote weight. When a
//! delegator joins, it's `reward_pool_total_earnings` field is set equal to the `total_earnings`
//! of the reward pool at that point in time. At best the reward pool has the rewards up through the
//! previous era. If a delegator joins prior to the election snapshot it will benefit from the
//! rewards for the active era despite not contributing to the pool's vote weight. If it joins
//! after the election snapshot is taken it will benefit from the rewards of the next _2_ eras
//! because it's vote weight will not be counted until the election snapshot in active era + 1.
//! Related: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/10861
//!
//! **Relevant extrinsics:**
//!
//! * [`Call::claim_payout`]
//!
//! ### Unbonding sub pools
//!
//! When a delegator unbonds, it's balance is unbonded in the bonded pool's account and tracked in
//! an unbonding pool associated with the active era. If no such pool exists, one is created. To
//! track which unbonding sub pool a delegator belongs too, a delegator tracks it's
//! `unbonding_era`.
//!
//! When a delegator initiates unbonding it's claim on the bonded pool
//! (`balance_to_unbond`) is computed as:
//!
//! ```text
//! balance_to_unbond = (bonded_pool.balance / bonded_pool.points) * delegator.points;
//! ```
//!
//! If this is the first transfer into an unbonding pool arbitrary amount of points can be issued
//! per balance. In this implementation unbonding pools are initialized with a 1 point to 1 balance
//! ratio (see [`POINTS_TO_BALANCE_INIT_RATIO`]). Otherwise, the unbonding pools hold the same
//! points to balance ratio properties as the bonded pool, so delegator points in the
//! unbonding pool are issued based on
//!
//! ```text
//! new_points_issued = (points_before_transfer / balance_before_transfer) * balance_to_unbond;
//! ```
//!
//! For scalability, a bound is maintained on the number of unbonding sub pools (see
//! [`TotalUnbondingPools`]). An unbonding pool is removed once its older than `current_era -
//! TotalUnbondingPools`. An unbonding pool is merged into the unbonded pool with
//!
//! ```text
//! unbounded_pool.balance = unbounded_pool.balance + unbonding_pool.balance;
//! unbounded_pool.points = unbounded_pool.points + unbonding_pool.points;
//! ```
//!
//! This scheme "averages" out the points value in the unbonded pool.
//!
//! Once a delgators `unbonding_era` is older than `current_era -
//! [sp_staking::StakingInterface::bonding_duration]`, it can can cash it's points out of the
//! corresponding unbonding pool. If it's `unbonding_era` is older than `current_era -
//! TotalUnbondingPools`, it can cash it's points from the unbonded pool.
//!
//! **Relevant extrinsics:**
//!
//! * [`Call::unbond_other`]
//! * [`Call::withdraw_unbonded_other`]
//!
//! ### Slashing
//!
//! This section assumes that the slash computation is executed by
//! [`pallet_staking::StakingLedger::slash`], which passes the information to this pallet via
//! [`sp_staking::OnStakerSlash::on_slash`].
//!
//! Unbonding pools need to be slashed to ensure all nominators whom where in the bonded pool
//! while it was backing a validator that equivocated are punished. Without these measures a
//! nominator could unbond right after a validator equivocated with no consequences.
//!
//! This strategy is unfair to delegators who joined after the slash, because they get slashed as
//! well, but spares delegators who unbond. The latter is much more important for security: if a
//! pool's validators are attacking the network, their delegators need to unbond fast! Avoiding
//! slashes gives them an incentive to do that if validators get repeatedly slashed.
//!
//! To be fair to joiners, this implementation also need joining pools, which are actively staking,
//! in addition to the unbonding pools. For maintenance simplicity these are not implemented. Related: https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/10860
//!
//! **Relevant methods:**
//!
//! * [`Pallet::do_slash`]
//!
//! ### Limitations
//!
//! * Delegators cannot vote with their staked funds because they are transferred into the pools
//!   account. In the future this can be overcome by allowing the delegators to vote with their
//!   bonded funds via vote splitting.
//! * Delegators cannot quickly transfer to another pool if they do no like nominations, instead
//!   they must wait for the unbonding duration.
//!
//! # Runtime builder warnings
//!
//! * Watch out for overflow of [`RewardPoints`] and [`BalanceOf`] types. Consider things like the
//!   chains total issuance, staking reward rate, and burn rate.
