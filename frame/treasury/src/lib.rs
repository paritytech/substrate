//! # Treasury Pallet
//!
//! The Treasury pallet provides a "pot" of funds that can be managed by stakeholders in the system
//! and a structure for making spending proposals from this pot.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Treasury Pallet itself provides the pot to store funds, and a means for stakeholders to
//! propose, approve, and deny expenditures. The chain will need to provide a method (e.g.
//! inflation, fees) for collecting funds.
//!
//! By way of example, the Council could vote to fund the Treasury with a portion of the block
//! reward and use the funds to pay developers.
//!
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! - **Proposal:** A suggestion to allocate funds from the pot to a beneficiary.
//! - **Beneficiary:** An account who will receive the funds from a proposal iff the proposal is
//!   approved.
//! - **Deposit:** Funds that a proposer must lock when making a proposal. The deposit will be
//!   returned or slashed if the proposal is approved or rejected respectively.
//! - **Pot:** Unspent funds accumulated by the treasury pallet.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! General spending/proposal protocol:
//! - `propose_spend` - Make a spending proposal and stake the required deposit.
//! - `reject_proposal` - Reject a proposal, slashing the deposit.
//! - `approve_proposal` - Accept the proposal, returning the deposit.
//! - `remove_approval` - Remove an approval, the deposit will no longer be returned.
//!
//! ## GenesisConfig
//!
//! The Treasury pallet depends on the [`GenesisConfig`].
