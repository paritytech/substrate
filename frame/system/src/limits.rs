/// can be dangerous for `Normal` class and should only be done with extra care and consideration.
///
/// Often it's desirable for some class of transactions to be added to the block despite it being
/// full. For instance one might want to prevent high-priority `Normal` transactions from pushing
/// out lower-priority `Operational` transactions. In such cases you might add a `reserved` capacity
/// for given class.
