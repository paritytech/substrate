//! # StakeTracker
//!
//! FRAME stake tracker pallet
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet listens to staking events through implementing the
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`] trait and forwards those events to one or multiple types (e.g. pallets) that
//! must be kept up to date with certain updates in staking. The pallet does not expose any
//! callables and acts as a multiplexer of staking events.
//!
//! Currently, the stake tracker pallet is used to update the semi-sorted target and voter lists
//! implemented through the bags lists pallet.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! The [`OnStakingUpdate`] implementation aims at achieving the following goals:
//!
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] keeps a semi-sorted list of validators, sorted by approvals
//! (including self-vote and nominations).
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] keeps a semi-sorted list of voters, sorted by bonded stake.
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] sorting must be *always* kept up to date, even in the event of new
//! nomination updates, nominator/validator slashes and rewards.
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] does not need to necessarily be kept up to date at all times (e.g.
//! slashes). Those updates may be done externally if possible (e.g. if the voter sorted list
//! provider is implemented using a bags-list pallet, the updates can be accomplished through
//! callables).
//!
//! ## Event emitter ordering and staking ledger state updates
//!
//! It is important to ensure that the events are emitted from staking (i.e. the calls into
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`]) *after* the caller ensures that the state of the staking ledger is up to
//! date, since the new state will be fetched and used to update the sorted lists accordingly.
