//! Storage migrations for the Election Provider Multi-phase pallet.
//!
//! The Election Provider Multi-phase pallet provides the necessary functionality
//! for running multi-phase elections in Substrate based blockchains. This module
//! contains storage migration implementations to transition the storage from
//! a previous version to the current one during runtime upgrades.
//!
//! Each runtime upgrade may introduce changes to the storage layout, and to ensure
//! smooth upgrades, a migration strategy is used.

/// This module contains the migration logic for transitioning the storage from version 0 to version
/// 1.
///
///
/// The `MigrateToV1` struct implements the `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait, which is called
/// during runtime upgrades. When the runtime is upgraded and this migration is executed,
/// it checks the current and on-chain storage versions to determine if the migration is
/// needed.
///
/// If the current storage version is 1 and the on-chain version is 0, the migration will
/// proceed. During migration, the module checks if the `SignedSubmissionIndices` storage
/// item exists. If it does, the module migrates its data to the new storage format.
///
/// The migration logic performs the following steps:
/// - Reads the existing `SignedSubmissionIndices` data from storage.
/// - Maps the data to the new format, including the current block number.
/// - Stores the new data in the storage with the updated format.
/// - Updates the current storage version to 1.
///
/// In this migration, the storage value type `SubmissionIndicesOf` for the storage item
/// `SignedSubmissionIndices` is changing from `BoundedBTreeMap<ElectionScore, u32,
/// SignedMaxSubmissions>` to `BoundedVec<(ElectionScore, BlockNumber, u32), SignedMaxSubmissions>`
/// to allow multiple submissions of same election score to be submitted. See https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/14645 for more details about this update.
///
/// If `SignedSubmissionIndices` does not exist, the migration proceeds without performing
/// any changes, and only updates the storage version.
///
/// Developers should implement specific migration steps for each version change if needed.
/// The `OnRuntimeUpgrade` trait allows the module to perform complex migrations efficiently
/// and transparently to the blockchain's users.
