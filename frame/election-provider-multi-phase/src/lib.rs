//! # Multi phase, offchain election provider pallet.
//!
//! Currently, this election-provider has two distinct phases (see [`Phase`]), **signed** and
//! **unsigned**.
//!
//! ## Phases
//!
//! The timeline of pallet is as follows. At each block,
//! [`frame_election_provider_support::ElectionDataProvider::next_election_prediction`] is used to
//! estimate the time remaining to the next call to
//! [`frame_election_provider_support::ElectionProvider::elect`]. Based on this, a phase is chosen.
//! The timeline is as follows.
//!
//! ```ignore
//!                                                                    elect()
//!                 +   <--T::SignedPhase-->  +  <--T::UnsignedPhase-->   +
//!   +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
//!    Phase::Off   +       Phase::Signed     +      Phase::Unsigned      +
//! ```
//!
//! Note that the unsigned phase starts [`pallet::Config::UnsignedPhase`] blocks before the
//! `next_election_prediction`, but only ends when a call to [`ElectionProvider::elect`] happens. If
//! no `elect` happens, the signed phase is extended.
//!
//! > Given this, it is rather important for the user of this pallet to ensure it always terminates
//! election via `elect` before requesting a new one.
//!
//! Each of the phases can be disabled by essentially setting their length to zero. If both phases
//! have length zero, then the pallet essentially runs only the fallback strategy, denoted by
//! [`Config::Fallback`].
//!
//! ### Signed Phase
//!
//! In the signed phase, solutions (of type [`RawSolution`]) are submitted and queued on chain. A
//! deposit is reserved, based on the size of the solution, for the cost of keeping this solution
//! on-chain for a number of blocks, and the potential weight of the solution upon being checked. A
//! maximum of `pallet::Config::SignedMaxSubmissions` solutions are stored. The queue is always
//! sorted based on score (worse to best).
//!
//! Upon arrival of a new solution:
//!
//! 1. If the queue is not full, it is stored in the appropriate sorted index.
//! 2. If the queue is full but the submitted solution is better than one of the queued ones, the
//!    worse solution is discarded, the bond of the outgoing solution is returned, and the new
//!    solution is stored in the correct index.
//! 3. If the queue is full and the solution is not an improvement compared to any of the queued
//!    ones, it is instantly rejected and no additional bond is reserved.
//!
//! A signed solution cannot be reversed, taken back, updated, or retracted. In other words, the
//! origin can not bail out in any way, if their solution is queued.
//!
//! Upon the end of the signed phase, the solutions are examined from best to worse (i.e. `pop()`ed
//! until drained). Each solution undergoes an expensive `Pallet::feasibility_check`, which ensures
//! the score claimed by this score was correct, and it is valid based on the election data (i.e.
//! votes and targets). At each step, if the current best solution passes the feasibility check,
//! it is considered to be the best one. The sender of the origin is rewarded, and the rest of the
//! queued solutions get their deposit back and are discarded, without being checked.
//!
//! The following example covers all of the cases at the end of the signed phase:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! Queue
//! +-------------------------------+
//! |Solution(score=20, valid=false)| +-->  Slashed
//! +-------------------------------+
//! |Solution(score=15, valid=true )| +-->  Rewarded, Saved
//! +-------------------------------+
//! |Solution(score=10, valid=true )| +-->  Discarded
//! +-------------------------------+
//! |Solution(score=05, valid=false)| +-->  Discarded
//! +-------------------------------+
//! |             None              |
//! +-------------------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! Note that both of the bottom solutions end up being discarded and get their deposit back,
//! despite one of them being *invalid*.
//!
//! ## Unsigned Phase
//!
//! The unsigned phase will always follow the signed phase, with the specified duration. In this
//! phase, only validator nodes can submit solutions. A validator node who has offchain workers
//! enabled will start to mine a solution in this phase and submits it back to the chain as an
//! unsigned transaction, thus the name _unsigned_ phase. This unsigned transaction can never be
//! valid if propagated, and it acts similar to an inherent.
//!
//! Validators will only submit solutions if the one that they have computed is sufficiently better
//! than the best queued one (see [`pallet::Config::BetterUnsignedThreshold`]) and will limit the
//! weight of the solution to [`MinerConfig::MaxWeight`].
//!
//! The unsigned phase can be made passive depending on how the previous signed phase went, by
//! setting the first inner value of [`Phase`] to `false`. For now, the signed phase is always
//! active.
//!
//! ### Fallback
//!
//! If we reach the end of both phases (i.e. call to [`ElectionProvider::elect`] happens) and no
//! good solution is queued, then the fallback strategy [`pallet::Config::Fallback`] is used to
//! determine what needs to be done. The on-chain election is slow, and contains no balancing or
//! reduction post-processing. If [`pallet::Config::Fallback`] fails, the next phase
//! [`Phase::Emergency`] is enabled, which is a more *fail-safe* approach.
//!
//! ### Emergency Phase
//!
//! If, for any of the below reasons:
//!
//! 1. No **signed** or **unsigned** solution submitted, and no successful [`Config::Fallback`] is
//!    provided
//! 2. Any other unforeseen internal error
//!
//! A call to `T::ElectionProvider::elect` is made, and `Ok(_)` cannot be returned, then the pallet
//! proceeds to the [`Phase::Emergency`]. During this phase, any solution can be submitted from
//! [`Config::ForceOrigin`], without any checking, via [`Pallet::set_emergency_election_result`]
//! transaction. Hence, `[`Config::ForceOrigin`]` should only be set to a trusted origin, such as
//! the council or root. Once submitted, the forced solution is kept in [`QueuedSolution`] until the
//! next call to `T::ElectionProvider::elect`, where it is returned and [`Phase`] goes back to
//! `Off`.
//!
//! This implies that the user of this pallet (i.e. a staking pallet) should re-try calling
//! `T::ElectionProvider::elect` in case of error, until `OK(_)` is returned.
//!
//! To generate an emergency solution, one must only provide one argument: [`Supports`]. This is
//! essentially a collection of elected winners for the election, and voters who support them. The
//! supports can be generated by any means. In the simplest case, it could be manual. For example,
//! in the case of massive network failure or misbehavior, [`Config::ForceOrigin`] might decide to
//! select only a small number of emergency winners (which would greatly restrict the next validator
//! set, if this pallet is used with `pallet-staking`). If the failure is for other technical
//! reasons, then a simple and safe way to generate supports is using the staking-miner binary
//! provided in the Polkadot repository. This binary has a subcommand named `emergency-solution`
//! which is capable of connecting to a live network, and generating appropriate `supports` using a
//! standard algorithm, and outputting the `supports` in hex format, ready for submission. Note that
//! while this binary lives in the Polkadot repository, this particular subcommand of it can work
//! against any substrate-based chain.
//!
//! See the `staking-miner` documentation in the Polkadot repository for more information.
//!
//! ## Feasible Solution (correct solution)
//!
//! All submissions must undergo a feasibility check. Signed solutions are checked one by one at the
//! end of the signed phase, and the unsigned solutions are checked on the spot. A feasible solution
//! is as follows:
//!
//! 0. **all** of the used indices must be correct.
//! 1. present *exactly* correct number of winners.
//! 2. any assignment is checked to match with [`RoundSnapshot::voters`].
//! 3. the claimed score is valid, based on the fixed point arithmetic accuracy.
//!
//! ## Accuracy
//!
//! The accuracy of the election is configured via [`SolutionAccuracyOf`] which is the accuracy that
//! the submitted solutions must adhere to.
//!
//! Note that the accuracy is of great importance. The offchain solution should be as small as
//! possible, reducing solutions size/weight.
//!
//! ## Error types
//!
//! This pallet provides a verbose error system to ease future debugging and debugging. The overall
//! hierarchy of errors is as follows:
//!
//! 1. [`pallet::Error`]: These are the errors that can be returned in the dispatchables of the
//!    pallet, either signed or unsigned. Since decomposition with nested enums is not possible
//!    here, they are prefixed with the logical sub-system to which they belong.
//! 2. [`ElectionError`]: These are the errors that can be generated while the pallet is doing
//!    something in automatic scenarios, such as `offchain_worker` or `on_initialize`. These errors
//!    are helpful for logging and are thus nested as:
//!    - [`ElectionError::Miner`]: wraps a [`unsigned::MinerError`].
//!    - [`ElectionError::Feasibility`]: wraps a [`FeasibilityError`].
//!    - [`ElectionError::Fallback`]: wraps a fallback error.
//!    - [`ElectionError::DataProvider`]: wraps a static str.
//!
//! Note that there could be an overlap between these sub-errors. For example, A
//! `SnapshotUnavailable` can happen in both miner and feasibility check phase.
//!
//! ## Future Plans
//!
//! **Emergency-phase recovery script**: This script should be taken out of staking-miner in
//! polkadot and ideally live in `substrate/utils/frame/elections`.
//!
//! **Challenge Phase**. We plan on adding a third phase to the pallet, called the challenge phase.
//! This is a phase in which no further solutions are processed, and the current best solution might
//! be challenged by anyone (signed or unsigned). The main plan here is to enforce the solution to
//! be PJR. Checking PJR on-chain is quite expensive, yet proving that a solution is **not** PJR is
//! rather cheap. If a queued solution is successfully proven bad:
//!
//! 1. We must surely slash whoever submitted that solution (might be a challenge for unsigned
//!    solutions).
//! 2. We will fallback to the emergency strategy (likely extending the current era).
//!
//! **Bailing out**. The functionality of bailing out of a queued solution is nice. A miner can
//! submit a solution as soon as they _think_ it is high probability feasible, and do the checks
//! afterwards, and remove their solution (for a small cost of probably just transaction fees, or a
//! portion of the bond).
//!
//! **Conditionally open unsigned phase**: Currently, the unsigned phase is always opened. This is
//! useful because an honest validator will run substrate OCW code, which should be good enough to
//! trump a mediocre or malicious signed submission (assuming in the absence of honest signed bots).
//! If there are signed submissions, they can be checked against an absolute measure (e.g. PJR),
//! then we can only open the unsigned phase in extreme conditions (i.e. "no good signed solution
//! received") to spare some work for the active validators.
//!
//! **Allow smaller solutions and build up**: For now we only allow solutions that are exactly
//! [`DesiredTargets`], no more, no less. Over time, we can change this to a [min, max] where any
//! solution within this range is acceptable, where bigger solutions are prioritized.
//!
//! **Score based on (byte) size**: We should always prioritize small solutions over bigger ones, if
//! there is a tie. Even more harsh should be to enforce the bound of the `reduce` algorithm.
//!
//! **Take into account the encode/decode weight in benchmarks.** Currently, we only take into
//! account the weight of encode/decode in the `submit_unsigned` given its priority. Nonetheless,
//! all operations on the solution and the snapshot are worthy of taking this into account.
