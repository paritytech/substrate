//! # Utility Pallet
//! A stateless pallet with helpers for dispatch management which does no re-authentication.
//!
//! - [`Config`]
//! - [`Call`]
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! This pallet contains two basic pieces of functionality:
//! - Batch dispatch: A stateless operation, allowing any origin to execute multiple calls in a
//!   single dispatch. This can be useful to amalgamate proposals, combining `set_code` with
//!   corresponding `set_storage`s, for efficient multiple payouts with just a single signature
//!   verify, or in combination with one of the other two dispatch functionality.
//! - Pseudonymal dispatch: A stateless operation, allowing a signed origin to execute a call from
//!   an alternative signed origin. Each account has 2 * 2**16 possible "pseudonyms" (alternative
//!   account IDs) and these can be stacked. This can be useful as a key management tool, where you
//!   need multiple distinct accounts (e.g. as controllers for many staking accounts), but where
//!   it's perfectly fine to have each of them controlled by the same underlying keypair.
//!   Derivative accounts are, for the purposes of proxy filtering considered exactly the same as
//!   the origin and are thus hampered with the origin's filters.
//!
//! Since proxy filters are respected in all dispatches of this pallet, it should never need to be
//! filtered by any proxy.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! #### For batch dispatch
//! * `batch` - Dispatch multiple calls from the sender's origin.
//!
//! #### For pseudonymal dispatch
//! * `as_derivative` - Dispatch a call from a derivative signed origin.

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
