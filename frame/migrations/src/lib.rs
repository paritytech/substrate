//! # `pallet-migrations`
//!
//! Provides multi block migrations for FRAME runtimes.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The pallet takes care of executing a batch of multi-step migrations over multiple blocks. The
//! process starts on each runtime upgrade. Normal and operational transactions are paused while
//! migrations are on-going.
//!
//! ### Example
//!
//! This example demonstrates a simple mocked walk through of a basic success scenario. The pallet
//! is configured with two migrations: one succeeding after just one step, and the second one
//! succeeding after two steps. A runtime upgrade is then enacted and the block number is advanced
//! until all migrations finish executing. Afterwards, the recorded historic migrations are
//! checked and events are asserted.
#![doc = docify::embed!("frame/migrations/src/tests.rs", simple_works)]
//!
//! ## Pallet API
//!
//! See the [`pallet`] module for more information about the interfaces this pallet exposes,
//! including its configuration trait, dispatchables, storage items, events and errors.
//!
//! Otherwise noteworthy API of this pallet include its implementation of the
//! [`MultiStepMigrator`] trait. This can be plugged into `frame-executive` to check for
//! transaction suspension.
//!
//! ### Design Goals
//!
//! 1. Must automatically execute migrations over multiple blocks.
//! 2. Must prevent other (non-mandatory) transactions to execute in the meantime.
//! 3. Must respect pessimistic weight bounds of migrations.
//! 4. Must execute migrations in order. Skipping is not allowed; migrations are run on an
//! all-or-nothing basis. 5. Must prevent re-execution of migrations.
//! 6. Must provide transactional storage semantics for migrations.
//! 7. Must guarantee progress.
//!
//! ### Design
//!
//! Migrations are provided to the pallet through the associated type [`Config::Migrations`] of type
//! `Get<Vec<Box<dyn SteppedMigration<â€¦`. This was done to have the most flexibility when it comes
//! to iterating and inspecting the migrations. It also simplifies the trait bounds since all
//! associated types of the trait must be provided by the pallet.  
//! The actual progress of the pallet is stored in its [`Cursor`] storage item. This can either be
//! [`MigrationCursor::Active`] or `Stuck`. In the active case it points to the currently active
//! migration and stores its inner cursor. The inner cursor can then be used by the migration to
//! store its inner state and advance. Each time when the migration returns `Some(cursor)`, it
//! signals the pallet that it is not done yet.   
//! The cursor is re-set on each runtime upgrade. This ensures that it starts to execute at the
//! first migration in the vector. The pallets cursor is only ever incremented or put into `Stuck`
//! once it encounters an error (Goal 4). Once in the stuck state, the pallet will stay stuck until
//! it is fixed through manual governance intervention.  
//! As soon as the cursor of the pallet becomes `Some(_)`; chain transaction processing is paused
//! by [`MultiStepMigrator::is_upgrading`] returning `true`. This ensures that no other
//! transactions are processed until all migrations are complete (Goal 2).  
//! `on_initialize` the pallet will load the current migration and check whether it was already
//! executed in the past by checking for membership of its ID in the `Historic` set. Historic
//! migrations are skipped without causing an error. Each successfully executed migration is added
//! to this set (Goal 5).  
//! This proceeds until no more migrations remain. At that point, the event `UpgradeCompleted` is
//! emitted (Goal 1).  
//! The execution of each migration happens by calling [`SteppedMigration::transactional_step`].
//! This function wraps the inner `step` function into a transactional layer to allow rollback in
//! the error case (Goal 6).  
//! Weight limits must be checked by the migration itself. The pallet provides a [`WeightMeter`] for
//! that purpose. The pallet may return [`SteppedMigrationError::InsufficientWeight`] at any point.
//! In that scenario, the one of two things will happen: if that migration was exclusively executed
//! in this block, and therefore required more than the maximum amount of weight possible, the
//! pallet becomes `Stuck`. Otherwise one re-attempt is attempted with the same logic in the next
//! block (Goal 3). Progress through the migrations is guaranteed by providing a timeout for each
//! migration via [`SteppedMigration::max_steps`]. The pallet **ONLY** guarantees progress if this
//! is set to sensible limits (Goal 7).
//!
//! ### Scenario: Governance cleanup
//!
//! Every now and then, governance can make use of the [`clear_historic`][Pallet::clear_historic]
//! call. This ensures that no old migrations pile up in the [`Historic`] set. This can probably be
//! done very rarely, since the storage should not grow quickly and the lookup weight does not
//! suffer much.
//!
//! ### Scenario: Successful upgrade
//!
//! The standard procedure for a successful runtime upgrade can look like this:
//! 1. Migrations are configured in the `Migrations` config item. All migrations expose
//! [`max_steps`][SteppedMigration::max_steps], are error tolerant, check their weight bounds and
//! have a unique identifier. 2. The runtime upgrade is enacted. `UpgradeStarted` events are
//! followed by lots of `MigrationAdvanced` events. Finally `UpgradeCompleted` is emitted.  
//! 3. Cleanup as described in the governance scenario be executed at any time after the migration
//! completes.
//!
//! ### Advice: Failed upgrades
//!
//! Failed upgrades cannot recovered from automatically and require governance intervention. Set up
//! monitoring for `UpgradeFailed` events to be made aware of any failures. The hook
//! [`OnMigrationUpdate::failed`] should be setup in a way that it allows governance to act, but
//! still prevent other transactions from interacting with the inconsistent storage state. Note that
//! this is paramount, since the inconsistent state might contain a faulty balance amount or similar
//! that could cause great harm if user transactions don't remain suspended. One way to implement
//! this would be to use the `SafeMode` or `TxPause` pallets that can prevent most user interactions
//! but still allow a whitelisted set of governance calls.
//!
//! ### Remark: Failed migrations
//!
//! Failed migrations are not added to the `Historic` set. This means that an erroneous
//! migration must be removed and fixed manually. This already applies, even before considering the
//! historic set.
//!
//! ### Remark: Transactional processing
//!
//! You can see the transactional semantics for migrational steps as mostly useless, since in the
//! stuck case the state is already messed up. This just prevents it from becoming even more messed
//! up , but doesn't prevent it in the first place.
