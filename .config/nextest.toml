# "retries" defines the number of times a test should be retried. If set to a
# non-zero value, tests that succeed on a subsequent attempt will be marked as
# non-flaky. Can be overridden through the `--retries` option.
# Examples
# * retries = 3
# * retries = { backoff = "fixed", count = 2, delay = "1s" }
# * retries = { backoff = "exponential", count = 10, delay = "1s", jitter = true, max-delay = "10s" }

# The number of threads to run tests with. Supported values are either an integer or
# the string "num-cpus". Can be overridden through the `--test-threads` option.

# mark certain tests as heavier than others. However, it can also be set as a global parameter.

# Show these test statuses in the output.
#
# The possible values this can take are:
# * none: no output
# * fail: show failed (including exec-failed) tests
# * retry: show flaky and retried tests
# * slow: show slow tests
# * pass: show passed tests
# * skip: show skipped tests (most useful for CI)
# * all: all of the above
#
# Each value includes all the values above it; for example, "slow" includes
# failed and retried tests.
#
# Can be overridden through the `--status-level` flag.

# "failure-output" defines when standard output and standard error for failing tests are produced.
# Accepted values are
# * "immediate": output failures as soon as they happen
# * "final": output failures at the end of the test run
# * "immediate-final": output failures as soon as they happen and at the end of
#   the test run; combination of "immediate" and "final"
# * "never": don't output failures at all
#
# For large test suites and CI it is generally useful to use "immediate-final".
#
# Can be overridden through the `--failure-output` option.

# "success-output" controls production of standard output and standard error on success. This should
# generally be set to "never".

# See <https://nexte.st/book/slow-tests> for more information.

# Optional: specify the parameter 'terminate-after' with a non-zero integer,
# which will cause slow tests to be terminated after the specified number of
# periods have passed.
# Example: slow-timeout = { period = "60s", terminate-after = 2 }
slow-timeout = { period = "60s" }

# Treat a test as leaky if after the process is shut down, standard output and standard error
# aren't closed within this duration.
#
# This usually happens in case of a test that creates a child process and lets it inherit those
# handles, but doesn't clean the child process up (especially when it fails).
