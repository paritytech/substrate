//! Substrate runtime api
//!
//! The Substrate runtime api is the interface between the node and the runtime. There isn't a fixed
//! set of runtime apis, instead it is up to the user to declare and implement these runtime apis.
//! The declaration of a runtime api is normally done outside of a runtime, while the implementation
//! of it has to be done in the runtime. We provide the [`decl_runtime_apis!`] macro for declaring
//! a runtime api and the [`impl_runtime_apis!`] for implementing them. The macro docs provide more
//! information on how to use them and what kind of attributes we support.
//!
//! It is required that each runtime implements at least the [`Core`] runtime api. This runtime api
//! provides all the core functions that Substrate expects from a runtime.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! Runtime apis support versioning. Each runtime api itself has a version attached. It is also
//! supported to change function signatures or names in a non-breaking way. For more information on
//! versioning check the [`decl_runtime_apis!`] macro.
//!
//! All runtime apis and their versions are returned as part of the [`RuntimeVersion`]. This can be
//! used to check which runtime api version is currently provided by the on-chain runtime.
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! For testing we provide the [`mock_impl_runtime_apis!`] macro that lets you implement a runtime
//! api for a mocked object to use it in tests.
//!
//! # Logging
//!
//! Substrate supports logging from the runtime in native and in wasm. For that purpose it provides
//! the [`RuntimeLogger`](sp_runtime::runtime_logger::RuntimeLogger). This runtime logger is
//! automatically enabled for each call into the runtime through the runtime api. As logging
//! introduces extra code that isn't actually required for the logic of your runtime and also
//! increases the final wasm blob size, it is recommended to disable the logging for on-chain
//! wasm blobs. This can be done by enabling the `disable-logging` feature of this crate. Be aware
//! that this feature instructs `log` and `tracing` to disable logging at compile time by setting
//! the `max_level_off` feature for these crates. So, you should not enable this feature for a
//! native build as otherwise the node will not output any log messages.
//!
//! # How does it work?
//!
//! Each runtime api is declared as a trait with functions. When compiled to WASM, each implemented
//! runtime api function is exported as a function with the following naming scheme
//! `${TRAIT_NAME}_${FUNCTION_NAME}`. Such a function has the following signature
//! `(ptr: *u8, length: u32) -> u64`. It takes a pointer to an `u8` array and its length as an
//! argument. This `u8` array is expected to be the SCALE encoded parameters of the function as
//! defined in the trait. The return value is an `u64` that represents `length << 32 | pointer` of
//! an `u8` array. This return value `u8` array contains the SCALE encoded return value as defined
//! by the trait function. The macros take care to encode the parameters and to decode the return
//! value.

/// Declares given traits as runtime apis.
///
/// The macro will create two declarations, one for using on the client side and one for using
/// on the runtime side. The declaration for the runtime side is hidden in its own module.
/// The client side declaration gets two extra parameters per function,
/// `&self` and `at: &BlockId<Block>`. The runtime side declaration will match the given trait
/// declaration. Besides one exception, the macro adds an extra generic parameter `Block:
/// BlockT` to the client side and the runtime side. This generic parameter is usable by the
/// user.
///
/// For implementing these macros you should use the
/// [`impl_runtime_apis!`] macro.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// sp_api::decl_runtime_apis! {
///     /// Declare the api trait.
///     pub trait Balance {
///         /// Get the balance.
///         fn get_balance() -> u64;
///         /// Set the balance.
///         fn set_balance(val: u64);
///     }

///
/// # Runtime api trait versioning
///
/// To support versioning of the traits, the macro supports the attribute `#[api_version(1)]`.
/// The attribute supports any `u32` as version. By default, each trait is at version `1`, if
/// no version is provided. We also support changing the signature of a method. This signature
/// change is highlighted with the `#[changed_in(2)]` attribute above a method. A method that
/// is tagged with this attribute is callable by the name `METHOD_before_version_VERSION`. This
/// method will only support calling into wasm, trying to call into native will fail (change
/// the spec version!). Such a method also does not need to be implemented in the runtime. It
/// is required that there exist the "default" of the method without the `#[changed_in(_)]`
/// attribute, this method will be used to call the current default implementation.
///
/// ```rust
/// sp_api::decl_runtime_apis! {
///     /// Declare the api trait.
///     #[api_version(2)]
///     pub trait Balance {
///         /// Get the balance.

///         /// Set balance.
