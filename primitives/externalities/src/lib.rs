//! Substrate externalities abstraction
//!
//! The externalities mainly provide access to storage and to registered extensions. Extensions
//! are for example the keystore or the offchain externalities. These externalities are used to
//! access the node from the runtime via the runtime interfaces.
//!
//! This crate exposes the main [`Externalities`] trait.
