//! Substrate runtime version
//!
//! Each runtime that should be executed by a Substrate based node needs to have a runtime version.
//! The runtime version is defined by [`RuntimeVersion`]. The runtime version is used to
//! distinguish different runtimes. The most important field is the
//! [`spec_version`](RuntimeVersion::spec_version). The `spec_version` should be increased in a
//! runtime when a new runtime build includes breaking changes that would make other runtimes unable
//! to import blocks built by this runtime or vice-versa, where the new runtime could not import
//! blocks built by the old runtime. The runtime version also carries other version information
//! about the runtime, see [`RuntimeVersion`] for more information on this.
//!
//! Substrate will fetch the runtime version from a `wasm` blob by first checking the
//! `runtime_version` link section or calling the `Core::version` runtime api. The link section can
//! be generated in the runtime using the [`runtime_version`] attribute. The `Core` runtime api also
//! needs to be implemented for the runtime using `impl_runtime_apis!`.

/// An attribute that accepts a version declaration of a runtime and generates a custom wasm
/// section with the equivalent contents.
///
/// The custom section allows to read the version of the runtime without having to execute any
/// code. Instead, the generated custom section can be relatively easily parsed from the wasm
/// binary. The identifier of the custom section is "runtime_version".
///
/// A shortcoming of this macro is that it is unable to embed information regarding supported
/// APIs. This is supported by the `construct_runtime!` macro.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This macro accepts a const item like the following:
///
/// ```rust
/// use sp_version::{create_runtime_str, RuntimeVersion};
///
/// #[sp_version::runtime_version]
/// pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
/// 	spec_name: create_runtime_str!("test"),
/// 	impl_name: create_runtime_str!("test"),
/// 	authoring_version: 10,
/// 	spec_version: 265,
/// 	impl_version: 1,
/// 	apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
/// 	transaction_version: 2,
/// 	state_version: 1,
/// };
///
/// # const RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS: sp_version::ApisVec = sp_version::create_apis_vec!([]);
/// ```
///
/// It will pass it through and add code required for emitting a custom section. The
/// information that will go into the custom section is parsed from the item declaration. Due
/// to that, the macro is somewhat rigid in terms of the code it accepts. There are the
/// following considerations:
///
/// - The `spec_name` and `impl_name` must be set by a macro-like expression. The name of the
///   macro doesn't matter though.
///
/// - `authoring_version`, `spec_version`, `impl_version` and `transaction_version` must be set
///   by a literal. Literal must be an integer. No other expressions are allowed there. In
///   particular, you can't supply a constant variable.
///
/// - `apis` doesn't have any specific constraints. This is because this information doesn't
///   get into the custom section and is not parsed.
///
/// # Compilation Target & "std" feature
///
/// This macro assumes it will be used within a runtime. By convention, a runtime crate defines
/// a feature named "std". This feature is enabled when the runtime is compiled to native code
/// and disabled when it is compiled to the wasm code.
///
/// The custom section can only be emitted while compiling to wasm. In order to detect the
/// compilation target we use the "std" feature. This macro will emit the custom section only
/// if the "std" feature is **not** enabled.
///
/// Including this macro in the context where there is no "std" feature and the code is not
/// compiled to wasm can lead to cryptic linking errors.
