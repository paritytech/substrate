//! Substrate runtime interface
//!
//! This crate provides types, traits and macros around runtime interfaces. A runtime interface is
//! a fixed interface between a Substrate runtime and a Substrate node. For a native runtime the
//! interface maps to a direct function call of the implementation. For a wasm runtime the interface
//! maps to an external function call. These external functions are exported by the wasm executor
//! and they map to the same implementation as the native calls.
//!
//! # Using a type in a runtime interface
//!
//! Any type that should be used in a runtime interface as argument or return value needs to
//! implement [`RIType`]. The associated type
//! [`FFIType`](./trait.RIType.html#associatedtype.FFIType) is the type that is used in the FFI
//! function to represent the actual type. For example `[T]` is represented by an `u64`. The slice
//! pointer and the length will be mapped to an `u64` value. For more information see this
//! [table](#ffi-type-and-conversion). The FFI function definition is used when calling from the
//! wasm runtime into the node.
//!
//! Traits are used to convert from a type to the corresponding
//! [`RIType::FFIType`](./trait.RIType.html#associatedtype.FFIType).
//! Depending on where and how a type should be used in a function signature, a combination of the
//! following traits need to be implemented:
//! <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->
//! 1. Pass as function argument: [`wasm::IntoFFIValue`] and [`host::FromFFIValue`]
//! 2. As function return value: [`wasm::FromFFIValue`] and [`host::IntoFFIValue`]
//! 3. Pass as mutable function argument: [`host::IntoPreallocatedFFIValue`]
//!
//! The traits are implemented for most of the common types like `[T]`, `Vec<T>`, arrays and
//! primitive types.
//!
//! For custom types, we provide the [`PassBy`](./pass_by#PassBy) trait and strategies that define
//! how a type is passed between the wasm runtime and the node. Each strategy also provides a derive
//! macro to simplify the implementation.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! To not waste any more performance when calling into the node, not all types are SCALE encoded
//! when being passed as arguments between the wasm runtime and the node. For most types that
//! are raw bytes like `Vec<u8>`, `[u8]` or `[u8; N]` we pass them directly, without SCALE encoding
//! them in front of. The implementation of [`RIType`] each type provides more information on how
//! the data is passed.
//!
//! # Declaring a runtime interface
//!
//! Declaring a runtime interface is similar to declaring a trait in Rust:
//!
//! ```
//! #[sp_runtime_interface::runtime_interface]
//! trait RuntimeInterface {
//!     fn some_function(value: &[u8]) -> bool {
//!         value.iter().all(|v| *v > 125)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more information on declaring a runtime interface, see
//! [`#[runtime_interface]`](./attr.runtime_interface.html).
//!
//! # FFI type and conversion
//!
//! The following table documents how values of types are passed between the wasm and
//! the host side and how they are converted into the corresponding type.
//!
//! | Type | FFI type | Conversion |
//! |----|----|----|
//! | `u8` | `u8` | `Identity` |
//! | `u16` | `u16` | `Identity` |

//! | `i128` | `u32` | `v.as_ptr()` (pointer to a 16 byte array) |
//! | `i8` | `i8` | `Identity` |
//! | `i16` | `i16` | `Identity` |
//! | `i32` | `i32` | `Identity` |

//! | `u128` | `u32` | `v.as_ptr()` (pointer to a 16 byte array) |
//! | `bool` | `u8` | `if v { 1 } else { 0 }` |
//! | `&str` | `u64` | <code>v.len() 32bit << 32 &#124; v.as_ptr() 32bit</code> |
//! | `&[u8]` | `u64` | <code>v.len() 32bit << 32 &#124; v.as_ptr() 32bit</code> |
//! | `Vec<u8>` | `u64` | <code>v.len() 32bit << 32 &#124; v.as_ptr() 32bit</code> |
//! | `Vec<T> where T: Encode` | `u64` | `let e = v.encode();`<br><br><code>e.len() 32bit << 32

//! | `Option<T>` | `u64` | `let e = v.encode();`<br><br><code>e.len() 32bit << 32 &#124; e.as_ptr()

//! `Identity` means that the value is converted directly into the corresponding FFI type.

///
/// # Argument types
///
/// The macro supports any kind of argument type, as long as it implements [`RIType`] and the
/// required `FromFFIValue`/`IntoFFIValue`. The macro will convert each
/// argument to the corresponding FFI representation and will call into the host using this FFI
/// representation. On the host each argument is converted back to the native representation
/// and the native implementation is called. Any return value is handled in the same way.
///
/// # Wasm only interfaces
///
/// Some interfaces are only required from within the wasm runtime e.g. the allocator
/// interface. To support this, the macro can be called like `#[runtime_interface(wasm_only)]`.
/// This instructs the macro to make two significant changes to the generated code:
///
/// 1. The generated functions are not callable from the native side.
/// 2. The trait as shown above is not implemented for `Externalities` and is instead
/// implemented    for `FunctionExecutor` (from `sp-wasm-interface`).
///
/// # Disable tracing
/// By addding `no_tracing` to the list of options you can prevent the wasm-side interface from
/// generating the default `sp-tracing`-calls. Note that this is rarely needed but only meant
/// for the case when that would create a circular dependency. You usually _do not_ want to add
/// this flag, as tracing doesn't cost you anything by default anyways (it is added as a no-op)
/// but is super useful for debugging later.
