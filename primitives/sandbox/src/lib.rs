//! This crate provides means to instantiate and execute wasm modules.
//!
//! It works even when the user of this library executes from
//! inside the wasm VM. In this case the same VM is used for execution
//! of both the sandbox owner and the sandboxed module, without compromising security
//! and without the performance penalty of full wasm emulation inside wasm.
//!
//! This is achieved by using bindings to the wasm VM, which are published by the host API.
//! This API is thin and consists of only a handful functions. It contains functions for
//! instantiating modules and executing them, but doesn't contain functions for inspecting the
//! module structure. The user of this library is supposed to read the wasm module.
//!
//! When this crate is used in the `std` environment all these functions are implemented by directly
//! calling the wasm VM.
//!
//! Examples of possible use-cases for this library are not limited to the following:
//!
//! - implementing smart-contract runtimes that use wasm for contract code
//! - executing a wasm substrate runtime inside of a wasm parachain
