//! A set of election algorithms to be used with a substrate runtime, typically within the staking
//! sub-system. Notable implementation include:
//!
//! - [`seq_phragmen`]: Implements the Phragmén Sequential Method. An un-ranked, relatively fast
//!   election method that ensures PJR, but does not provide a constant factor approximation of the
//!   maximin problem.
//! - [`phragmms`](phragmms::phragmms): Implements a hybrid approach inspired by Phragmén which is
//!   executed faster but it can achieve a constant factor approximation of the maximin problem,
//!   similar to that of the MMS algorithm.
//! - [`balance`](balancing::balance): Implements the star balancing algorithm. This iterative
//!   process can push a solution toward being more "balanced", which in turn can increase its
//!   score.
//!
//! ### Terminology
//!
//! This crate uses context-independent words, not to be confused with staking. This is because the
//! election algorithms of this crate, while designed for staking, can be used in other contexts as
//! well.
//!
//! `Voter`: The entity casting some votes to a number of `Targets`. This is the same as `Nominator`
//! in the context of staking. `Target`: The entities eligible to be voted upon. This is the same as
//! `Validator` in the context of staking. `Edge`: A mapping from a `Voter` to a `Target`.
//!
//! The goal of an election algorithm is to provide an `ElectionResult`. A data composed of:
//! - `winners`: A flat list of identifiers belonging to those who have won the election, usually
//!   ordered in some meaningful way. They are zipped with their total backing stake.
//! - `assignment`: A mapping from each voter to their winner-only targets, zipped with a ration
//!   denoting the amount of support given to that particular target.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use sp_npos_elections::*;
//! # use sp_runtime::Perbill;
//! // the winners.
//! let winners = vec![(1, 100), (2, 50)];
//! let assignments = vec![
//!     // A voter, giving equal backing to both 1 and 2.
//!     Assignment {
//! 		who: 10,
//! 		distribution: vec![(1, Perbill::from_percent(50)), (2, Perbill::from_percent(50))],
//! 	},
//!     // A voter, Only backing 1.
//!     Assignment { who: 20, distribution: vec![(1, Perbill::from_percent(100))] },
//! ];
//!
//! // the combination of the two makes the election result.
//! let election_result = ElectionResult { winners, assignments };
//! ```
//!
//! The `Assignment` field of the election result is voter-major, i.e. it is from the perspective of
//! the voter. The struct that represents the opposite is called a `Support`. This struct is usually
//! accessed in a map-like manner, i.e. keyed by voters, therefor it is stored as a mapping called
//! `SupportMap`.
//!
//! Moreover, the support is built from absolute backing values, not ratios like the example above.
//! A struct similar to `Assignment` that has stake value instead of ratios is called an
//! `StakedAssignment`.
//!
//!
//! More information can be found at: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12990>
