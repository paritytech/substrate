/// Execute sequential phragmen with potentially some rounds of `balancing`. The return type is list
/// of winners and a weight distribution vector of all voters who contribute to the winners.
///
/// - This function is a best effort to elect `rounds` members. Nonetheless, if less candidates are
///   available, it will only return what is available. It is the responsibility of the call site to
///   ensure they have provided enough members.
/// - If `balance` parameter is `Some(i, t)`, `i` iterations of balancing is with tolerance `t` is
///   performed.
/// - Returning winners are sorted based on desirability. Voters are unsorted. Nonetheless,
///   seq-phragmen is in general an un-ranked election and the desirability should not be
///   interpreted with any significance.
/// - The returning winners are zipped with their final backing stake. Yet, to get the exact final
///   weight distribution from the winner's point of view, one needs to build a support map. See
///   [`crate::SupportMap`] for more info. Note that this backing stake is computed in
///   ExtendedBalance and may be slightly different that what will be computed from the support map,
///   due to accuracy loss.
/// - The accuracy of the returning edge weight ratios can be configured via the `P` generic
///   argument.
/// - The returning weight distribution is _normalized_, meaning that it is guaranteed that the sum
///   of the ratios in each voter's distribution sums up to exactly `P::one()`.
///
/// This can only fail of the normalization fails. This can happen if for any of the resulting
/// assignments, `assignment.distribution.map(|p| p.deconstruct()).sum()` fails to fit inside
/// `UpperOf<P>`. A user of this crate may statically assert that this can never happen and safely
/// `expect` this to return `Ok`.
///
/// This can only fail if the normalization fails.
///
/// Note that rounding errors can potentially cause the output of this function to fail a t-PJR
/// check where t is the standard threshold. The underlying algorithm is sound, but the conversions
/// between numeric types can be lossy.
