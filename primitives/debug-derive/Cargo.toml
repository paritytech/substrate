# By default `RuntimeDebug` implements `Debug` that outputs `<wasm:stripped>` when `std` is
# disabled. However, sometimes downstream users need to have the real `Debug` implementation for
# debugging purposes. If this is required, a user only needs to add this crate as a dependency of
# their runtime and enable the `force-debug` feature.
