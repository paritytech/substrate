//! Substrate genesis config builder
//!
//! This Runtime API allows to construct `GenesisConfig`, in particular:
//! - serialize the runtime default `GenesisConfig` struct into json format,
//! - put the GenesisConfig struct into the storage. Internally this operation calls
//!   `GenesisBuild::build` function for all runtime pallets, which is typically provided by
//!   pallet's author.
//! - deserialize the `GenesisConfig` from given json blob and put `GenesisConfig` into the state
//!   storage. Allows to build customized configuration.
//!
//! Providing externalities with empty storage and putting `GenesisConfig` into storage allows to
//! catch and build the raw storage of `GenesisConfig` which is the foundation for genesis block.

		///
		/// If the provided JSON patch is incorrect or the deserialization fails, this method will panic.

		/// The patching process modifies the default `GenesisConfig` according to the followingÂ rules:
		/// 1. Existing keys in the default configuration will be overridden by the corresponding values in the patch.
		/// 2. If a key exists in the patch but not in the default configuration, it will be added to the resulting `GenesisConfig`.
		/// 3. Keys in the default configuration that have null values in the patch will be removed from the resulting
		///    `GenesisConfig`. This is helpful for changing enum variant value.

		/// Please note the patch may contain full `GenesisConfig`.
