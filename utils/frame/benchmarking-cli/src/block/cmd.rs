/// Benchmark the execution time of historic blocks.
///
/// This can be used to verify that blocks do not use more weight than they consumed
/// in their `WeightInfo`. Example:
///
/// Let's say you are on a Substrate chain and want to verify that the first 3 blocks
/// did not use more weight than declared which would otherwise be an issue.
/// To test this with a dev node, first create one with a temp directory:
///
/// $ substrate --dev -d /tmp/my-dev --execution wasm --wasm-execution compiled
///
/// And wait some time to let it produce 3 blocks. Then benchmark them with:
///
/// $ substrate benchmark-block --from 1 --to 3 --dev -d /tmp/my-dev
///   --execution wasm --wasm-execution compiled --pruning archive
///
/// The output will be similar to this:
///
/// Block 1 with 1 tx used 77.34% of its weight ( 5,308,964 of 6,864,645 ns)
/// Block 2 with 1 tx used 77.99% of its weight ( 5,353,992 of 6,864,645 ns)
/// Block 3 with 1 tx used 75.91% of its weight ( 5,305,938 of 6,989,645 ns)
///
/// The percent number is important and indicates how much weight
/// was used as compared to the consumed weight.
/// This number should be below 100% for reference hardware.
