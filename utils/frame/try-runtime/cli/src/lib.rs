//! # Try-runtime
//!
//! Substrate's ultimate testing framework for the power users.
//!
//! > As the name suggests, `try-runtime` is a detailed testing framework that gives you a lot of
//! control over what is being executed in which environment. It is recommended that user's first
//! familiarize themselves with substrate in depth, particularly the execution model. It is critical
//! to deeply understand how the wasm/client/runtime interactions, and the runtime apis work in the
//! substrate runtime, before commencing to working with `try-runtime`.
//!
//! #### Resources
//!
//! Some resources about the above:
//!
//! 1. <https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/try-runtime/>
//! 2. <https://www.crowdcast.io/e/substrate-seminar/41>
//! 3. <https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/runtime-development/>
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Background Knowledge
//!
//! The basis of all try-runtime commands is the same: connect to a live node, scrape its *state*
//! and put it inside a `TestExternalities`, then call into a *specific runtime-api* using the given
//! state and some *runtime*.
//!
//! Alternatively, the state could come from a snapshot file.
//!
//! All of the variables in the above statement are made *italic*. Let's look at each of them:
//!
//! 1. **State** is the key-value pairs of data that comprise the canonical information that any
//!    blockchain is keeping. A state can be full (all key-value pairs), or be partial (only pairs
//!    related to some pallets/prefixes). Moreover, some keys are especial and are not related to
//!    specific pallets, known as [`well_known_keys`] in substrate. The most important of these is
//!    the `:CODE:` key, which contains the code used for execution, when wasm execution is chosen.
//!
//! 2. *A runtime-api* call is a call into a function defined in the runtime, *on top of a given
//!    state*. Each subcommand of `try-runtime` utilizes a specific *runtime-api*.
//!
//! 3. Finally, the **runtime** is the actual code that is used to execute the aforementioned
//!    runtime-api. Everything in this crate assumes wasm execution, which means the runtime that
//!    you use is the one stored onchain, namely under the `:CODE:` key.
//!
//! To recap, a typical try-runtime command does the following:
//!
//! 1. Download the state of a live chain, and write to an `externalities`.
//! 2. Overwrite the `:CODE:` with a given wasm blob
//! 3. Test some functionality via calling a runtime-api.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use any of the provided commands, [`SharedParams`] must be provided. The most important of
//! which being [`SharedParams::runtime`], which specifies which runtime to use. Furthermore,
//! [`SharedParams::overwrite_state_version`] can be used to alter the state-version (see
//! <https://forum.polkadot.network/t/state-trie-migration/852> for more info).
//!
//! Then, the specific command has to be specified. See [`Command`] for more information about each
//! command's specific customization flags, and assumptions regarding the runtime being used.
//!
//! Said briefly, this CLI is capable of executing:
//!
//! * [`Command::OnRuntimeUpgrade`]: execute all the `on_runtime_upgrade` hooks.
//! * [`Command::ExecuteBlock`]: re-execute the given block.
//! * [`Command::OffchainWorker`]: re-execute the given block's offchain worker code path.
//! * [`Command::FollowChain`]: continuously execute the blocks of a remote chain on top of a given
//!   runtime.
//! * [`Command::CreateSnapshot`]: Create a snapshot file from a remote node.
//!
//! Finally, To make sure there are no errors regarding this, always run any `try-runtime` command
//! with `executor=trace` logging targets, which will specify which runtime is being used per api
//! call. Moreover, `remote-ext`, `try-runtime` and `runtime` logs targets will also be useful.
//!
//! ## Spec name check
//!
//! A common pitfall is that you might be running some test on top of the state of chain `x`, with
//! the runtime of chain `y`. To avoid this all commands do a spec-name check before executing
//! anything by default. This will check the, if any alterations are being made to the `:CODE:`,
//! then the spec names match. The spec versions are warned, but are not mandated to match.
//!
//! > If anything, in most cases, we expect spec-versions to NOT match, because try-runtime is all
//! > about testing unreleased runtimes.
//!
//! ## Note on signature and state-root checks
//!
//! All of the commands calling into `TryRuntime_execute_block` ([`Command::ExecuteBlock`] and
//! [`Command::FollowChain`]) disable both state root and signature checks. This is because in 99%
//! of the cases, the runtime that is being tested is different from the one that is stored in the
//! canonical chain state. This implies:
//!
//! 1. the state root will NEVER match, because `:CODE:` is different between the two.
//! 2. replaying all transactions will fail, because the spec-version is part of the transaction
//!    signature.
//!
//! ## Best Practices
//!
//! Try-runtime is all about battle-testing unreleased runtime. The following list of suggestions
//! help developers maximize the testing coverage and make base use of `try-runtime`.
//!
//! #### Adding pre/post hooks
//!
//! One of the gems that come only in the `try-runtime` feature flag is the `pre_upgrade` and
//! `post_upgrade` hooks for `OnRuntimeUpgrade`. This trait is implemented either inside the pallet,
//! or manually in a runtime, to define a migration. In both cases, these functions can be added,
//! given the right flag:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
//! fn pre_upgrade() -> Result<Vec<u8>, TryRuntimeError> {}
//!
//! #[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
//! fn post_upgrade(state: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), TryRuntimeError> {}
//! ```
//!
//! (The pallet macro syntax will support this simply as a part of `#[pallet::hooks]`).
//!
//! These hooks allow you to execute some code, only within the `on-runtime-upgrade` command, before
//! and after the migration. Moreover, `pre_upgrade` can return a `Vec<u8>` that contains arbitrary
//! encoded data (usually some pre-upgrade state) which will be passed to `post_upgrade` after
//! upgrading and used for post checking.
//!
//! ## State Consistency
//!
//! Similarly, each pallet can expose a function in `#[pallet::hooks]` section as follows:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[cfg(feature = "try-runtime")]
//! fn try_state(_: BlockNumber) -> Result<(), TryRuntimeError> {}
//! ```
//!
//! which is called on numerous code paths in the try-runtime tool. These checks should ensure that
//! the state of the pallet is consistent and correct. See `frame_support::try_runtime::TryState`
//! for more info.
//!
//! #### Logging
//!
//! It is super helpful to make sure your migration code uses logging (always with a `runtime` log
//! target prefix, e.g. `runtime::balance`) and state exactly at which stage it is, and what it is
//! doing.
//!
//! #### Guarding migrations
//!
//! Always make sure that any migration code is guarded either by `StorageVersion`, or by some
//! custom storage item, so that it is NEVER executed twice, even if the code lives in two
//! consecutive runtimes.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! For the following examples, we assume the existence of the following:
//!
//! 1. a substrate node compiled without `--feature try-runtime`, called `substrate`. This will be
//! the running node that you connect to. then, after some changes to this node, you compile it with
//! `--features try-runtime`. This gives you:
//! 2. a substrate binary that has the try-runtime sub-command enabled.
//! 3. a wasm blob that has try-runtime functionality.
//!
//! ```bash
//! # this is like your running deployed node.
//! cargo build --release && cp target/release/substrate .
//!
//! # this is like your WIP branch.
//! cargo build --release --features try-runtime
//! cp target/release/substrate substrate-try-runtime
//! cp ./target/release/wbuild/kitchensink-runtime/kitchensink_runtime.wasm runtime-try-runtime.wasm
//! ```
//!
//! > The above example is with `substrate`'s `kitchensink-runtime`, but is applicable to any
//! > substrate-based chain that has implemented `try-runtime-cli`.
//!
//! * If you run `try-runtime` subcommand against `substrate` binary listed above, you get the
//!   following error.
//!
//! ```bash
//! [substrate] ./substrate try-runtime
//! Error: Input("TryRuntime wasn't enabled when building the node. You can enable it with `--features try-runtime`.")
//! ```
//!
//! * If you run the same against `substrate-try-runtime`, it will work.
//!
//! ```bash
//! [substrate] ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime
//! Try some command against runtime state
//!
//! Usage: substrate-try-runtime try-runtime [OPTIONS] --runtime <RUNTIME> <COMMAND>
//!
//! Commands:
//!   on-runtime-upgrade  Execute the migrations of the "local runtime"
//!   execute-block       Executes the given block against some state
//!   offchain-worker     Executes *the offchain worker hooks* of a given block against some state
//!   follow-chain        Follow the given chain's finalized blocks and apply all of its extrinsics
//!   create-snapshot     Create a new snapshot file
//!   help                Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
//!
//! Options:
//!       --chain <CHAIN_SPEC>
//!           Specify the chain specification
//!       --dev
//!           Specify the development chain
//!   -d, --base-path <PATH>
//!           Specify custom base path
//!   -l, --log <LOG_PATTERN>...
//!           Sets a custom logging filter. Syntax is `<target>=<level>`, e.g. -lsync=debug
//!       --detailed-log-output
//!           Enable detailed log output
//!       --disable-log-color
//!           Disable log color output
//!       --enable-log-reloading
//!           Enable feature to dynamically update and reload the log filter
//!       --tracing-targets <TARGETS>
//!           Sets a custom profiling filter. Syntax is the same as for logging: `<target>=<level>`
//!       --tracing-receiver <RECEIVER>
//!           Receiver to process tracing messages [default: log] [possible values: log]
//!       --runtime <RUNTIME>
//!           The runtime to use
//!       --wasm-execution <METHOD>
//!           Type of wasm execution used [default: compiled] [possible values: interpreted-i-know-what-i-do, compiled]
//!       --wasm-instantiation-strategy <STRATEGY>
//!           The WASM instantiation method to use [default: pooling-copy-on-write] [possible values: pooling-copy-on-write, recreate-instance-copy-on-write, pooling, recreate-instance, legacy-instance-reuse]
//!       --heap-pages <HEAP_PAGES>
//!           The number of 64KB pages to allocate for Wasm execution. Defaults to [`sc_service::Configuration.default_heap_pages`]
//!       --overwrite-state-version <OVERWRITE_STATE_VERSION>
//!           Overwrite the `state_version`
//!   -h, --help
//!           Print help information (use `--help` for more detail)
//!   -V, --version
//!           Print version information
//! ```
//!
//! * Run the migrations of a given runtime on top of a live state.
//!
//! ```bash
//! # assuming there's `./substrate --dev --tmp --ws-port 9999` or similar running.
//! ./substrate-try-runtime \
//!     try-runtime \
//!     --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!     -lruntime=debug \
//!     on-runtime-upgrade \
//!     live --uri ws://localhost:9999
//! ```
//!
//! * Same as the previous one, but run it at specific block number's state. This means that this
//! block hash's state shall not yet have been pruned in `rpc.polkadot.io`.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime \
//!     try-runtime \
//!     --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!     -lruntime=debug \
//!     on-runtime-upgrade \
//!     live --uri ws://localhost:9999 \
//!     # replace with your desired block hash!
//!     --at 0xa1b16c1efd889a9f17375ec4dd5c1b4351a2be17fa069564fced10d23b9b3836
//! ```
//!
//! * Executing the same command with the [`Runtime::Existing`] will fail because the existing
//!   runtime, stored onchain in `substrate` binary that we compiled earlier does not have
//!   `try-runtime` feature!
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime --runtime existing -lruntime=debug on-runtime-upgrade live --uri ws://localhost:9999
//! ...
//! Error: Input("given runtime is NOT compiled with try-runtime feature!")
//! ```
//!
//! * Now, let's use a snapshot file. First, we create the snapshot:
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime --runtime existing -lruntime=debug create-snapshot --uri ws://localhost:9999
//! 2022-12-13 10:28:17.516  INFO main try-runtime::cli: snapshot path not provided (-s), using 'node-268@latest.snap'
//! 2022-12-13 10:28:17.516  INFO                 main remote-ext: since no at is provided, setting it to latest finalized head, 0xe7d0b614dfe89af65b33577aae46a6f958c974bf52f8a5e865a0f4faeb578d22
//! 2022-12-13 10:28:17.516  INFO                 main remote-ext: since no prefix is filtered, the data for all pallets will be downloaded
//! 2022-12-13 10:28:17.550  INFO                 main remote-ext: writing snapshot of 1611464 bytes to "node-268@latest.snap"
//! 2022-12-13 10:28:17.551  INFO                 main remote-ext: initialized state externalities with storage root 0x925e4e95de4c08474fb7f976c4472fa9b8a1091619cd7820a793bf796ee6d932 and state_version V1
//! ```
//!
//! > Note that the snapshot contains the `existing` runtime, which does not have the correct
//! > `try-runtime` feature. In the following commands, we still need to overwrite the runtime.
//!
//! Then, we can use it to have the same command as before, `on-runtime-upgrade`
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime \
//!     --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!     -lruntime=debug \
//!     on-runtime-upgrade \
//!     snap -s node-268@latest.snap
//! ```
//!
//! * Execute the latest finalized block with the given runtime.
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime \
//!     --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!     -lruntime=debug \
//!     execute-block live \
//!     --uri ws://localhost:9999
//! ```
//!
//! This can still be customized at a given block with `--at`. If you want to use a snapshot, you
//! can still use `--block-ws-uri` to provide a node form which the block data can be fetched.
//!
//! Moreover, this runs the `frame_support::try_runtime::TryState` hooks as well. The hooks to run
//! can be customized with the `--try-state`. For example:
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime try-runtime \
//!    --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!    -lruntime=debug \
//!    execute-block \
//!    --try-state System,Staking \
//!    live \
//!    --uri ws://localhost:9999 \
//!    --pallet System Staking
//! ```
//!
//! Will only run the `try-state` of the two given pallets. When running `try-state` against
//! some real chain data it can take a long time for the command to execute since it has to
//! query all the key-value pairs. In scenarios like above where we only want to run the
//! `try-state` for some specific pallets, we can use the `--pallet` option to specify from
//! which pallets we want to query the state. This will greatly decrease the execution time.
//!
//! See [`frame_try_runtime::TryStateSelect`] for more information.
//!
//! * Follow our live chain's blocks using `follow-chain`, whilst running the try-state of 3 pallets
//!   in a round robin fashion
//!
//! ```bash
//! ./substrate-try-runtime \
//!     try-runtime \
//!     --runtime runtime-try-runtime.wasm \
//!     -lruntime=debug \
//!     follow-chain \
//!     --uri ws://localhost:9999 \
//!     --try-state rr-3
//! ```
