//! # Wasm builder is a utility for building a project as a Wasm binary
//!
//! The Wasm builder is a tool that integrates the process of building the WASM binary of your
//! project into the main `cargo` build process.
//!
//! ## Project setup
//!
//! A project that should be compiled as a Wasm binary needs to:
//!
//! 1. Add a `build.rs` file.
//! 2. Add `wasm-builder` as dependency into `build-dependencies`.
//!
//! The `build.rs` file needs to contain the following code:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use substrate_wasm_builder::WasmBuilder;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     WasmBuilder::new()
//!         // Tell the builder to build the project (crate) this `build.rs` is part of.
//!         .with_current_project()
//!         // Make sure to export the `heap_base` global, this is required by Substrate
//!         .export_heap_base()
//!         // Build the Wasm file so that it imports the memory (need to be provided by at instantiation)
//!         .import_memory()
//!         // Build it.
//!         .build()
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! As the final step, you need to add the following to your project:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! include!(concat!(env!("OUT_DIR"), "/wasm_binary.rs"));
//! ```
//!
//! This will include the generated Wasm binary as two constants `WASM_BINARY` and
//! `WASM_BINARY_BLOATY`. The former is a compact Wasm binary and the latter is the Wasm binary as
//! being generated by the compiler. Both variables have `Option<&'static [u8]>` as type.
//!
//! ### Feature
//!
//! Wasm builder supports to enable cargo features while building the Wasm binary. By default it
//! will enable all features in the wasm build that are enabled for the native build except the
//! `default` and `std` features. Besides that, wasm builder supports the special `runtime-wasm`
//! feature. This `runtime-wasm` feature will be enabled by the wasm builder when it compiles the
//! Wasm binary. If this feature is not present, it will not be enabled.
//!
//! ## Environment variables
//!
//! By using environment variables, you can configure which Wasm binaries are built and how:
//!
//! - `SKIP_WASM_BUILD` - Skips building any Wasm binary. This is useful when only native should be
//!   recompiled. If this is the first run and there doesn't exist a Wasm binary, this will set both
//!   variables to `None`.
//! - `WASM_BUILD_TYPE` - Sets the build type for building Wasm binaries. Supported values are
//!   `release` or `debug`. By default the build type is equal to the build type used by the main
//!   build.
//! - `FORCE_WASM_BUILD` - Can be set to force a Wasm build. On subsequent calls the value of the
//!   variable needs to change. As wasm-builder instructs `cargo` to watch for file changes this
//!   environment variable should only be required in certain circumstances.
//! - `WASM_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS` - Extend `RUSTFLAGS` given to `cargo build` while building the wasm
//!   binary.
//! - `WASM_BUILD_NO_COLOR` - Disable color output of the wasm build.
//! - `WASM_TARGET_DIRECTORY` - Will copy any build Wasm binary to the given directory. The path
//!   needs to be absolute.
//! - `WASM_BUILD_TOOLCHAIN` - The toolchain that should be used to build the Wasm binaries. The
//!   format needs to be the same as used by cargo, e.g. `nightly-2020-02-20`.
//! - `WASM_BUILD_WORKSPACE_HINT` - Hint the workspace that is being built. This is normally not
//!   required as we walk up from the target directory until we find a `Cargo.toml`. If the target
//!   directory is changed for the build, this environment variable can be used to point to the
//!   actual workspace.
//! - `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE` - If `true`, `--offline` will be passed to all processes launched to
//!   prevent network access. Useful in offline environments.
//!
//! Each project can be skipped individually by using the environment variable
//! `SKIP_PROJECT_NAME_WASM_BUILD`. Where `PROJECT_NAME` needs to be replaced by the name of the
//! cargo project, e.g. `node-runtime` will be `NODE_RUNTIME`.
//!
//! ## Prerequisites:
//!
//! Wasm builder requires the following prerequisites for building the Wasm binary:
//!
//! - rust nightly + `wasm32-unknown-unknown` toolchain
//!
//! If a specific rust nightly is installed with `rustup`, it is important that the wasm target is
//! installed as well. For example if installing the rust nightly from 20.02.2020 using `rustup
//! install nightly-2020-02-20`, the wasm target needs to be installed as well `rustup target add
//! wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2020-02-20`.
